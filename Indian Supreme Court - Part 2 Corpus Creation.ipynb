       "'dr. b.s. chauhan, j.1.   this reference before us arises out of a variety of views  having\\n      been expressed by this court and several high courts of the country on\\n      the scope and extent of the powers of the courts  under  the  criminal\\n      justice system to arraign any person as an accused during  the  course\\n      of inquiry or trial as contemplated under section 319 of the  code  of\\n      criminal procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as the `cr.p.c.’).2.    the initial reference was made by a two-judge bench  vide  order\\n      dated 7.11.2008 in the leading case of hardeep singh (crl. appeal  no.\\n      1750 of 2008)  where noticing the conflict between  the  judgments  in\\n      the case of rakesh v. state of haryana, air 2001 sc 2521; and  a  two-\\n      judge bench decision in the case of mohd. shafi v. mohd. rafiq & anr.,\\n      air 2007 sc 1899, a doubt was expressed about the correctness  of  the\\n      view in the case of mohd. shafi (supra). the doubts as categorised  in\\n      paragraphs 75 and 78 of the reference order led to the framing of  two\\n      questions by the said bench which are reproduced hereunder:3.    the reference was desired to be resolved by a three-judge  bench\\n      whereafter the same came up for consideration  and  vide  order  dated\\n      8.12.2011, the court opined that in view of the reference made in  the\\n      case of dharam pal & ors. v. state of haryana & anr., (2004) 13 scc 9,\\n      the issues involved being identical in  nature,  the  same  should  be\\n      resolved by a constitution bench consisting of at least  five  judges.\\n      the bench felt that since a three-judge bench has already referred the\\n      matter of dharam pal (supra) to a constitution  bench,  then  in  that\\n      event it would be appropriate that such overlapping issues should also\\n      be resolved by a bench of similar strength.4.    reference made in the case of dharam  pal  (supra)  came  to  be\\n      answered in relation to the power of a court  of  sessions  to  invoke\\n      section 319 cr.p.c. at the stage of committal of the case to  a  court\\n      of sessions. the said reference was answered by the constitution bench\\n      in the case of dharam pal & ors. v. state of haryana & anr., air  2013\\n      sc 3018 [hereinafter called ‘dharam pal (cb)’], wherein  it  was  held\\n      that a court of sessions can with  the  aid  of  section  193  cr.p.c.\\n      proceed to array any other person and summon him for being tried  even\\n      if the provisions of section 319  cr.p.c.  could  not  be  pressed  in\\n      service at the stage of committal.thus, after the reference was made by a three-judge bench in the\\n      present case, the powers so far as the court of sessions is concerned,\\n      to invoke section  319  cr.p.c.  at  the  stage  of  committal,  stood\\n      answered finally in the aforesaid background.5.    on the consideration of the submissions raised and  in  view  of\\n      what has been noted above, the following questions are to be  answered\\n      by this bench:6.    in this reference what we are primarily concerned with,  is  the\\n      stage at which such powers can be invoked and, secondly, the  material\\n      on the basis whereof the invoking of such powers can be justified.  to\\n      add as a corollary to the same, thirdly,  the  manner  in  which  such\\n      power has to be exercised, also has to be considered.7.   the constitutional mandate  under  articles  20  and  21  of  the\\n      constitution  of  india,  1950  (hereinafter  referred   to   as   the\\n      ‘constitution’)  provides  a  protective  umbrella  for   the   smooth\\n      administration of justice making adequate provisions to ensure a  fair\\n      and efficacious trial so that the  accused  does  not  get  prejudiced\\n      after the law has been put into motion to try him for the offence  but\\n      at the same time also gives equal protection to  victims  and  to  the\\n      society at large to ensure that the guilty does not get away from  the\\n      clutches of law.  for the empowerment of the courts to ensure that the\\n      criminal  administration  of  justice  works  properly,  the  law  was\\n      appropriately codified and  modified  by  the  legislature  under  the\\n      cr.p.c. indicating as to how the courts should  proceed  in  order  to\\n      ultimately find out the  truth  so  that  an  innocent  does  not  get\\n      punished but at the same time, the guilty are brought  to  book  under\\n      the law. it is these ideals as enshrined under  the  constitution  and\\n      our laws that  have  led  to  several  decisions,  whereby  innovating\\n      methods and progressive tools have been forged to find  out  the  real\\n      truth and to ensure that the   guilty  does  not  go  unpunished.  the\\n      presumption of innocence is the general law of the land as  every  man\\n      is presumed to be innocent unless proven to be guilty.8.   alternatively, certain  statutory  presumptions  in  relation  to\\n      certain class of offences have been raised against the accused whereby\\n      the presumption of guilt prevails  till  the  accused  discharges  his\\n      burden upon an onus being cast upon him under the law to prove himself\\n      to be innocent.  these competing theories have been kept  in  mind  by\\n      the legislature. the entire effort, therefore, is  not  to  allow  the\\n      real perpetrator of an offence to get away unpunished. this is also  a\\n      part of fair trial and in our opinion, in order to achieve  this  very\\n      end that the  legislature  thought  of  incorporating   provisions  of\\n      section 319 cr.p.c.9.    it is with the said object  in  mind  that  a  constructive  and\\n      purposive interpretation should be adopted that advances the cause  of\\n      justice and does not dilute the intention of  the  statute  conferring\\n      powers on the court to carry out the above mentioned avowed object and\\n      purpose to try the person to the  satisfaction  of  the  court  as  an\\n      accomplice in the commission of the offence that is subject matter  of\\n      trial.10.  in order to answer the aforesaid  questions  posed,  it  will  be\\n      appropriate to refer to section 351 of the  criminal  procedure  code,\\n      1898 (hereinafter referred to  as  `old  code’),  where  an  analogous\\n      provision existed, empowering the court to  summon  any  person  other\\n      than the accused if he is found to be connected with the commission of\\n      the offence. however, when the new cr.p.c. was being  drafted,  regard\\n      was had to 41st  report of the law commission where in the  paragraphs\\n      24.80 and 24.81 recommendations were made to make this provision  more\\n      comprehensive. the said recommendations read:11.   section 319 cr.p.c. as it exists today, is quoted hereunder:12.   section 319 cr.p.c. springs out of the doctrine  judex  damnatur\\n      cum nocens absolvitur (judge is condemned when  guilty  is  acquitted)\\n      and this doctrine must be used as a beacon light while explaining  the\\n      ambit and the spirit underlying the enactment of section 319 cr.p.c.it is the duty of the court to do justice by punishing the  real\\n      culprit. where the investigating agency for any reason does not  array\\n      one of the real culprits as an accused, the court is not powerless  in\\n      calling the said accused to face trial.  the  question  remains  under\\n      what circumstances and at what stage should  the  court  exercise  its\\n      power as contemplated in section 319 cr.p.c.?the submissions that were raised before us covered a  very  wide\\n      canvas  and  the  learned  counsel  have  taken  us  through   various\\n      provisions of cr.p.c. and the judgments that have been relied  on  for\\n      the said purpose. the controversy centers around the  stage  at  which\\n      such powers can be invoked by the court and the material on the  basis\\n      whereof such powers can be exercised.13.   it would be necessary to put on record that the power  conferred\\n      under section 319 cr.p.c. is only on the court.this has to be  understood  in  the  context  that  section  319\\n      cr.p.c. empowers only the court to proceed against  such  person.  the\\n      word “court” in our hierarchy of  criminal  courts  has  been  defined\\n      under section 6  cr.p.c.,  which  includes  the  courts  of  sessions,\\n      judicial magistrates, metropolitan magistrates as  well  as  executive\\n      magistrates. the court of sessions is defined in section 9 cr.p.c. and\\n      the courts of judicial magistrates has been defined under  section  11\\n      thereof.  the courts of  metropolitan  magistrates  has  been  defined\\n      under section 16 cr.p.c. the courts which can try  offences  committed\\n      under the indian penal code, 1860 or any offence under any other  law,\\n      have been specified under section 26 cr.p.c. read with first schedule.\\n      the explanatory note (2)  under  the  heading  of  “classification  of\\n      offences”  under  the  first   schedule   specifies   the   expression\\n      ‘magistrate  of  first  class’  and  ‘any   magistrate’   to   include\\n      metropolitan magistrates who are empowered to try the  offences  under\\n      the said schedule but excludes executive magistrates.14.   it is at this stage the  comparison  of  the  words  used  under\\n      section 319 cr.p.c. has to be understood distinctively from  the  word\\n      used under section 2(g) defining an inquiry other than the trial by  a\\n      magistrate or a court. here the legislature has used two words, namely\\n      the magistrate  or  court,  whereas  under  section  319  cr.p.c.,  as\\n      indicated above, only the word “court” has  been  recited.   this  has\\n      been done by the legislature to emphasise that the power under section\\n      319 cr.p.c. is exercisable only by the court and not  by  any  officer\\n      not acting as  a  court.  thus,  the  magistrate  not  functioning  or\\n      exercising powers as  a  court  can  make  an  inquiry  in  particular\\n      proceeding other than a trial but the material so collected would  not\\n      be by a court during  the  course  of  an  inquiry  or  a  trial.  the\\n      conclusion therefore, in short, is that in order to invoke  the  power\\n      under section 319 cr.p.c., it is only a court of sessions or  a  court\\n      of  magistrate performing the duties as a court under the cr.p.c. that\\n      can utilise the material  before  it  for  the  purpose  of  the  said\\n      section.15.   section 319 cr.p.c. allows the  court  to  proceed  against  any\\n      person who is not an accused in a case before it.   thus,  the  person\\n      against whom summons are issued in exercise of  such  powers,  has  to\\n      necessarily not be an accused already facing trial. he can either be a\\n      person named in column 2 of the chargesheet filed  under  section  173\\n      cr.p.c. or a person whose name has  been  disclosed  in  any  material\\n      before the court that is to be considered for the  purpose  of  trying\\n      the offence, but not  investigated.  he  has  to  be  a  person  whose\\n      complicity may be indicated and connected with the commission  of  the\\n      offence.16.   the legislature cannot be presumed  to  have  imagined  all  the\\n      circumstances and, therefore, it is the duty of the court to give full\\n      effect to the words used by the legislature so  as  to  encompass  any\\n      situation which the court may have to tackle while proceeding  to  try\\n      an offence and not allow a person who deserves to be tried to go  scot\\n      free by being not arraigned in the trial in spite  of  possibility  of\\n      his complicity which can be gathered from the documents  presented  by\\n      the prosecution.17.   the court is the sole repository of justice and a duty  is  cast\\n      upon it to  uphold  the  rule  of  law  and,  therefore,  it  will  be\\n      inappropriate to deny the existence of such powers with the courts  in\\n      our criminal justice system where it is not  uncommon  that  the  real\\n      accused, at times, get away by manipulating the  investigating  and/or\\n      the prosecuting agency.  the desire to avoid trial is so  strong  that\\n      an accused makes efforts at times to get himself absolved even at  the\\n      stage of investigation or inquiry even though he may be connected with\\n      the commission of the offence.18.  coming to the stage at which power under section 319 cr.p.c.  can\\n      be exercised, in dharam  pal  (supra),  this  court  had  noticed  the\\n      conflict in the decisions of kishun singh & ors  v.  state  of  bihar,\\n      (1993) 2 scc 16 and ranjit singh v. state of punjab, air 1998 sc 3148,\\n      and referred the matter to the  constitution  bench.   however,  while\\n      referring the matter to a constitution bench, this court affirmed  the\\n      judgment in kishun singh (supra) and doubted the  correctness  of  the\\n      judgment in ranjit singh (supra). in ranjit singh (supra), this  court\\n      observed that from the stage of  committal  till  the  sessions  court\\n      reaches the stage indicated in section 230  cr.p.c.,  that  court  can\\n      deal with only the accused referred to  in  section  209  cr.p.c.  and\\n      there is no intermediary stage till then for the sessions court to add\\n      any other person to the array of the accused, while  in  kishun  singh\\n      (supra), this court came to the  conclusion  that  even  the  sessions\\n      court has power under section 193 cr.p.c. to take  cognizance  of  the\\n      offence and summon other persons whose complicity in the commission of\\n      the trial can prima facie be gathered from the materials available  on\\n      record and need not wait till the stage  of  section  319  cr.p.c.  is\\n      reached. this court in dharam pal (supra)  held  that  the  effect  of\\n      ranjit singh (supra) would be that in less serious offences triable by\\n      a magistrate, the said court would have the power to  proceed  against\\n      those who are mentioned in column 2 of the  charge-sheet,  if  on  the\\n      basis of  material  on  record,  the  magistrate  disagrees  with  the\\n      conclusion reached by the police, but,  as  far  as  serious  offences\\n      triable by the court of sessions are concerned, that court  will  have\\n      to wait till the stage of section 319 cr.p.c. is reached.19.   at the very outset, we may explain that the issue that was being\\n      considered by this court in  dharam pal (cb), was the exercise of such\\n      power at the stage of committal of a case and the court held that even\\n      if section 319 cr.p.c. could not be invoked at that stage, section 193\\n      cr.p.c. could be invoked for the said purpose. we are not delving into\\n      the said issue which had been answered by the five-judge bench of this\\n      court. however, we may clarify that the opening words of  section  193\\n      cr.p.c. categorically recite that the power of the court  of  sessions\\n      to take cognizance would commence only after committal of the case  by\\n      a magistrate. the said provision  opens  with  a  non-obstante  clause\\n      “except as otherwise expressly provided by this code or by  any  other\\n      law for the time being in force”. the section therefore  is  clarified\\n      by the said opening words which clearly means that  if  there  is  any\\n      other provision  under  cr.p.c.,  expressly  making  a  provision  for\\n      exercise of powers by the court to  take  cognizance,  then  the  same\\n      would apply and the provisions of section 193  cr.p.c.  would  not  be\\n      applicable.20.   in our opinion, section 319 cr.p.c.  is  an  enabling  provision\\n      empowering the court to take appropriate steps for proceeding  against\\n      any person not being an accused for also having committed the  offence\\n      under trial.  it is this part which is  under  reference  before  this\\n      court and therefore in  our  opinion,  while  answering  the  question\\n      referred to herein, we do not find any conflict so as  to  delve  upon\\n      the situation that was dealt by this court in dharam pal (cb).21.   in elachuri venkatachinnayya & ors. v. king-emperor  (1920)  ilr\\n      43 mad 511, this court held that an inquiry  is  a  stage  before  the\\n      committal to a higher court. in fact, from a careful  reading  of  the\\n      judgments under reference i.e. ranjit singh (supra) and  kishun  singh\\n      (supra), it emerges that there is no dispute even in these  two  cases\\n      that the stage of committal is neither an inquiry nor a trial, for  in\\n      both the cases, the real dispute was whether section 193  cr.p.c.  can\\n      be invoked at the time of committal to summon an accused to face trial\\n      who is not already an accused. it can safely be  said  that  both  the\\n      cases are in harmony as to the said stage neither  being  a  stage  of\\n      inquiry nor a trial.22.   once the aforesaid stand is clarified in relation to  the  stage\\n      of committal before the court of sessions, the answer to the  question\\n      posed now, stands focussed only on the stage at which such powers  can\\n      be exercised by the court other than the stage of  committal  and  the\\n      material on the basis whereof such powers can be invoked by the court.question no.(i) what is the stage at which  power  under  section  319\\n      cr.p.c. can be exercised?23.   the stage of inquiry and trial upon cognizance being taken of an\\n      offence, has been considered by a large number of  decisions  of  this\\n      court and that it may be useful to  extract  the  same  hereunder  for\\n      proper appreciation of the stage  of  invoking  of  the  powers  under\\n      section 319 cr.p.c. to understand the meaning that can  be  attributed\\n      to the word ‘inquiry’ and ‘trial’ as used under the section.24.   in raghubans dubey v. state of bihar, air  1967  sc  1167,  this\\n      court held :25.   the  stage  of  inquiry  commences,  insofar  as  the  court  is\\n      concerned, with the filing of the charge-sheet and  the  consideration\\n      of the material collected by the prosecution, that is mentioned in the\\n      charge-sheet for the purpose of trying the accused.  this  has  to  be\\n      understood in terms of section 2(g) cr.p.c., which defines an  inquiry\\n      as follows:“2(g)  “inquiry”  means  every  inquiry,  other  than  a  trial,\\n           conducted under this code by a magistrate or court.”26.   in state of u.p. v. lakshmi brahman & anr.,  air  1983  sc  439,\\n      this court held that from the  stage  of  filing  of  charge-sheet  to\\n      ensuring the compliance of provision  of  section   207  cr.p.c.,  the\\n      court is only at the stage of inquiry and no trial can be said to have\\n      commenced. the above view has been held to  be  per  incurium  in  raj\\n      kishore prasad v. state of bihar & anr., air  1996  sc  1931,  wherein\\n      this court while observing that section 319 (1) cr.p.c. operates in an\\n      ongoing inquiry into, or trial of, an offence, held that at the  stage\\n      of section 209 cr.p.c., the court is neither at the stage  of  inquiry\\n      nor at the stage of trial. even at the stage of ensuring compliance of\\n      sections 207 and 208 cr.p.c., it cannot be said that the court  is  at\\n      the stage of inquiry because there is no judicial application of  mind\\n      and all that the magistrate is required to do  is  to  make  the  case\\n      ready to be heard by the court of sessions.27.   trial is distinct from an inquiry and must  necessarily  succeed\\n      it. the purpose of the trial is to fasten the  responsibility  upon  a\\n      person on the basis of  facts  presented  and  evidence  led  in  this\\n      behalf. in moly & anr. v. state of kerala,  air  2004  sc  1890,  this\\n      court observed that though the word ‘trial’  is  not  defined  in  the\\n      code, it is clearly distinguishable from inquiry. inquiry must  always\\n      be a forerunner to the trial. a three-judge bench of this court in the\\n      state of bihar v.\\xa0ram naresh pandey & anr., air 1957 sc 389 held:28.   in ratilal bhanji mithani v. state of maharashtra  &  ors.,  air\\n      1979 sc 94, this court held :29.   in v.c. shukla v. state through c.b.i., air 1980  sc  962,  this\\n      court held:30.   in union of india & ors.   v.  major  general  madan  lal  yadav\\n      (retd.), air 1996 sc 1340, a three-judge bench while dealing with  the\\n      proceedings in general court martial under the provisions of the  army\\n      act 1950, applied  legal  maxim  “nullus  commodum  capere  potest  de\\n      injuria sua propria” (no one can take advantage of his own wrong), and\\n      referred to various dictionary meanings of the word ‘trial’  and  came\\n      to the conclusion:31.   in “common cause”, a registered society  thr.  its  director  v.\\n      union of india & ors., air 1997 sc 1539, this court while dealing with\\n      the issue held:32.   in raj kishore prasad (supra), this court said that as  soon  as\\n      the prosecutor is present before the court and that  court  hears  the\\n      parties on framing of charges and discharge, trial  is  said  to  have\\n      commenced and that there is no intermediate stage between committal of\\n      case and framing of charge.33.   in in re: narayanaswamy naidu v. unknown 1 ind cas 228,  a  full\\n      bench of the madras high court  held  that   “trial  begins  when  the\\n      accused is charged and called on  to  answer  and  then  the  question\\n      before the court  is  whether  the  accused  is  to  be  acquitted  or\\n      convicted and not whether the complaint is  to  be  dismissed  or  the\\n      accused discharged.” a similar view has  been  taken  by  madras  high\\n      court subsequently in sriramulu v.  veerasalingam,  (1914)  i.l.r.  38\\n      mad. 585.34.   however, the bombay high court in dagdu govindshet wani v. punja\\n      vedu wani (1936) 38 bom.l.r. 1189 referring to sriramulu (supra)  held\\n      :empress, (1898) i.l.r. 25 cal. 863, that is to say,   trial  has\\n           always been understood to mean the  proceeding  which  commences\\n           when the case is called on with the magistrate on the bench, the\\n           accused in the dock and the representatives of  the  prosecution\\n           and, defence, if the accused be defended, present in  court  for\\n           the hearing of the case.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n           a similar view has been taken by the lahore high court in  sahib\\n      din v. the crown, (1922) i.l.r. 3 lah. 115, wherein it was  held  that\\n      for the purposes of section 350 of the code, a trial cannot be said to\\n      commence only when a charge is framed. the trial covers the  whole  of\\n      the  proceedings  in  a  warrant  case.  this  case  was  followed  in\\n      fakhruddin v. the crown, (1924) i.l.r. 6 lah. 176; and in labhsing  v.\\n      emperor, (1934) 35 cr.l. j. 1261.35.   in view of the above, the law can be summarised  to  the  effect\\n      that as ‘trial’ means determination of issues adjudging the  guilt  or\\n      the innocence of a person, the person has to be aware of what  is  the\\n      case against him and it is only at the stage of framing of the charges\\n      that the court informs him of the same, the ‘trial’ commences only  on\\n      charges being framed. thus, we do not approve the view  taken  by  the\\n      courts that in a criminal case, trial commences  on  cognizance  being\\n      taken.36.   section 2(g) cr.p.c.  and  the  case  laws  referred  to  above,\\n      therefore, clearly envisage inquiry before the actual commencement  of\\n      the trial, and is an act conducted under cr.p.c. by the magistrate  or\\n      the court. the word ‘inquiry’ is, therefore, not any inquiry  relating\\n      to the investigation of the case by the investigating agency but is an\\n      inquiry after the case is brought to the notice of the  court  on  the\\n      filing of the charge-sheet.  the court can thereafter proceed to  make\\n      inquiries and it is for this reason that an inquiry has been given  to\\n      mean something other than the actual trial.37.    even the  word  “course”  occurring  in  section  319  cr.p.c.,\\n      clearly indicates that the power can  be  exercised  only  during  the\\n      period when the inquiry has been commenced and  is  going  on  or  the\\n      trial which has commenced and is going on.  it  covers the entire wide\\n      range of the process of the pre-trial and the trial stage.   the  word\\n      “course” therefore, allows the court to invoke this power  to  proceed\\n      against any person from the initial stage of inquiry upto the stage of\\n      the conclusion of the  trial.   the  court  does  not  become  functus\\n      officio even if cognizance is taken so far as it is looking  into  the\\n      material qua any other  person  who  is  not  an  accused.   the  word\\n      “course” ordinarily conveys a meaning of a  continuous  progress  from\\n      one point to the next in time and conveys the  idea  of  a  period  of\\n      time; duration and not a fixed point of time.  (see:  commissioner  of\\n      income-tax, new delhi (now rajasthan)  v.  m/s.  east  west  import  &\\n      export (p) ltd. (now known as asian  distributors  ltd.)  jaipur,  air\\n      1989 sc 836).38.   in a somewhat similar manner, it has  been  attributed  to  word\\n      “course” the meaning of being a gradual and continuous  flow  advanced\\n      by journey or passage from one place  to  another  with  reference  to\\n      period of time when the  movement  is  in  progress.  (see:  state  of\\n      travancore-cochin & ors. v. shanmugha vilas cashewnut factory, quilon,\\n      air 1953 sc 333).39.   to say that powers under section 319 cr.p.c.  can  be  exercised\\n      only during trial would be reducing the impact of the  word  ‘inquiry’\\n      by the court.  it is a settled principle of law that an interpretation\\n      which leads to the conclusion that a word used by the  legislature  is\\n      redundant,  should  be  avoided  as  the  presumption  is   that   the\\n      legislature has  deliberately  and  consciously  used  the  words  for\\n      carrying out the purpose of the act. the legal maxim \"a  verbis  legis\\n      non est recedendum\" which means, \"from the words of law, there must be\\n      no departure\" has to be kept in mind.40.   the court cannot proceed with an assumption that the legislature\\n      enacting the statute has committed a mistake and where the language of\\n      the statute is plain and unambiguous, the court cannot go  behind  the\\n      language of the statute so as to add or subtract a  word  playing  the\\n      role of a political reformer or of a wise counsel to the  legislature.\\n      the court has to proceed on the footing that the legislature  intended\\n      what it has said and even if there is some defect in  the  phraseology\\n      etc., it is for others than the  court  to  remedy  that  defect.  the\\n      statute requires to be interpreted without doing any violence  to  the\\n      language used therein. the court cannot re-write,  recast  or  reframe\\n      the legislation for the reason that it has no power to legislate.41.   no word in a statute has to be construed as surplusage. no  word\\n      can be rendered ineffective or purposeless.  courts  are  required  to\\n      carry  out  the  legislative  intent  fully  and   completely.   while\\n      construing a provision, full effect is to be  given  to  the  language\\n      used therein, giving reference to the context and other provisions  of\\n      the statute. by construction, a provision should not be reduced  to  a\\n      “dead letter” or “useless lumber”. an interpretation which  renders  a\\n      provision an otiose should be avoided otherwise it would mean that  in\\n      enacting such  a  provision,  the  legislature  was  involved  in  “an\\n      exercise in futility” and the product came as a “purposeless piece” of\\n      legislation and that  the  provision  had  been  enacted  without  any\\n      purpose and the entire exercise to enact such a  provision  was  “most\\n      unwarranted  besides  being  uncharitable.”  (vide:  patel   chunibhai\\n      dajibha etc. v. narayanrao khanderao jambekar  &  anr.,  air  1965  sc\\n      1457; the martin burn ltd.

registrar\\n      of co-operative societies & ors., air 1998 sc 703).42.   this court in rohitash kumar & ors. v. om prakash sharma & ors.,\\n      air 2013 sc 30, after placing reliance on various earlier judgments of\\n      this court held:the word ‘inquiry’ is not surpulsage in the said provision.43.   since after the filing of the charge-sheet,  the  court  reaches\\n      the stage of inquiry and as soon as the court frames the charges,  the\\n      trial commences, and therefore, the power under section 319(1) cr.p.c.\\n      can be exercised at any time  after  the  charge-sheet  is  filed  and\\n      before the pronouncement of  judgment,  except  during  the  stage  of\\n      section 207/208 cr.p.c., committal etc., which  is  only  a  pre-trial\\n      stage, intended to put the process into motion. this stage  cannot  be\\n      said to be a judicial step in the true sense for it only  requires  an\\n      application of mind rather than a judicial application of mind.44.   at this pre-trial stage, the magistrate is required  to  perform\\n      acts in the nature of administrative work rather than judicial such as\\n      ensuring compliance of sections 207 and 208  cr.p.c.,  and  committing\\n      the matter if it is exclusively triable by sessions court.  therefore,\\n      it would be legitimate for us to conclude that the magistrate  at  the\\n      stage of   sections 207  to  209  cr.p.c.  is  forbidden,  by  express\\n      provision of section 319 cr.p.c., to apply his mind to the  merits  of\\n      the case and determine as to whether any accused needs to be added  or\\n      subtracted to face trial before the court of sessions.45.   it may be pertinent to refer to the decision in the case of  raj\\n      kishore prasad (supra) where, in order to avoid any  delay  in  trial,\\n      the court emphasised that such a power should be exercised keeping  in\\n      view the context in which the words “inquiry” and  “trial”  have  been\\n      used under section 319 cr.p.c. and came to the conclusion that such  a\\n      power is not available at the pre-trial stage and  should  be  invoked\\n      only at the stage of inquiry or after evidence is recorded.46.   a two-judge bench of this court in m/s. swil ltd.  v.  state  of\\n      delhi & anr.,  air 2001 sc 2747, held that once the process  has  been\\n      issued, power under section 319 cr.p.c.  cannot  be  exercised  as  at\\n      that stage, since it is neither an inquiry nor a trial.in ranjit singh (supra), the court held :“so from the stage of committal till the sessions court  reaches\\n           the stage indicated in section 230 of the code, that  court  can\\n           deal with only the accused referred to in  section  209  of  the\\n           code. there is no intermediary stage till then for the  sessions\\n           court to add any other person  to  the  array  of  the  accused.\\n           thus, once the sessions court takes cognizance  of  the  offence\\n           pursuant to the committal order, the only other stage  when  the\\n           court is empowered to add any other person to the array  of  the\\n           accused is after reaching evidence collection when powers  under\\n           section 319 of the code can be invoked”47.   in  kishun  singh  (supra),  the  court  while  considering  the\\n      provision of the old code, the law commission’s recommendation and the\\n      provisions in the  cr.p.c.,  held  that  section  319  cr.p.c.  is  an\\n      improved provision upon the earlier one. it has removed the difficulty\\n      of taking cognizance as cognizance against the added person  would  be\\n      deemed to have been taken as originally against the other  co-accused.\\n      therefore, on magistrate committing the case under section 209 cr.p.c.\\n      to the court of sessions, the bar of section 193 cr.p.c.  gets  lifted\\n      thereby investing  the  court  of  sessions  complete  and  unfettered\\n      jurisdiction of the court of original jurisdiction to take  cognizance\\n      of the offence which would include the  summoning  of  the  person  or\\n      persons whose complicity in the commission  of  the  crime  can  prima\\n      facie be gathered from the material available on record, though who is\\n      not an accused before the court.48.   in dharam pal (cb), the constitution bench approved the decision\\n      in kishun singh (supra) that the sessions judge has original power  to\\n      summon accused holding that “the sessions judge was entitled to  issue\\n      summons under section\\xa0193\\xa0code of criminal  procedure  upon  the  case\\n      being committed to him by the magistrate. the key words in section 193\\n      are that \"no court of session shall take cognizance of any offence  as\\n      a court of original jurisdiction unless the case has been committed to\\n      it by a magistrate under this code.\" the above provision entails  that\\n      a case must, first of all, be committed to the court of session by the\\n      magistrate. the second condition is that only after the case had  been\\n      committed to it, could the court of session  take  cognizance  of  the\\n      offence exercising original jurisdiction.  although,  an  attempt  has\\n      been   made   to   suggest   that   the   cognizance   indicated    in\\n      section\\xa0193\\xa0deals not with  cognizance  of  an  offence,  but  of  the\\n      commitment order passed by the learned magistrate, we are not inclined\\n      to accept such a submission in the clear wordings of section\\xa0193  that\\n      the court of session may take cognizance of  the  offences  under  the\\n      said section”49.   it is thus aptly clear that until  and unless the  case  reaches\\n      the stage of inquiry or trial by the court, the  power  under  section\\n      319 cr.p.c. cannot be exercised. in fact, this  proposition  does  not\\n      seem to have been disturbed by the constitution bench  in  dharam  pal\\n      (cb). the dispute therein was resolved visualizing a situation wherein\\n      the court was concerned with procedural delay and was of  the  opinion\\n      that the sessions court should not necessarily wait till the stage  of\\n      section 319 cr.p.c. is reached to direct a person, not  facing  trial,\\n      to appear and face trial as an accused. we are in full agreement  with\\n      the interpretation given by the constitution bench  that  section  193\\n      cr.p.c. confers power of original jurisdiction upon the sessions court\\n      to add an accused once the case has been committed to it.50.   in our opinion, the stage of inquiry does  not  contemplate  any\\n      evidence in its strict legal sense, nor  the  legislature  could  have\\n      contemplated this inasmuch as the  stage  for  evidence  has  not  yet\\n      arrived.  the only material that  the  court  has  before  it  is  the\\n      material collected by the prosecution and  the  court  at  this  stage\\n      prima facie can apply its mind to find out as to whether a person, who\\n      can be an accused, has been erroneously omitted from  being  arraigned\\n      or has been deliberately excluded by the prosecuting  agencies.   this\\n      is all the more necessary in order to ensure  that  the  investigating\\n      and the prosecuting agencies have acted fairly in bringing before  the\\n      court those persons who deserve to be tried and to prevent any  person\\n      from being deliberately shielded when they ought to have  been  tried.\\n      this is necessary to usher faith in the judicial  system  whereby  the\\n      court should be empowered to exercise such powers even at the stage of\\n      inquiry and it is for this reason that the legislature has consciously\\n      used separate terms, namely, inquiry or trial in section 319 cr.p.c.accordingly, we hold that the court can exercise the power under\\n      section 319 cr.p.c. only after the trial proceeds and  commences  with\\n      the recording of the evidence and also in exceptional circumstances as\\n      explained herein above.51.   there is yet another  set  of  provisions  which  form  part  of\\n      inquiry  relevant  for  the  purposes  of  section  319  cr.p.c.  i.e.\\n      provisions of sections 200, 201, 202, etc. cr.p.c. applicable  in  the\\n      case of complaint cases. as has been discussed herein, evidence  means\\n      evidence adduced before the  court.  complaint  cases  is  a  distinct\\n      category of criminal trial where some sort of evidence in  the  strict\\n      legal sense of section  3  of  the  evidence  act  1872,  (hereinafter\\n      referred to as the ‘evidence act’) comes before the court.  there does\\n      not seem to be any  restriction  in  the  provisions  of  section  319\\n      cr.p.c. so as to preclude such evidence as coming before the court  in\\n      complaint cases even before charges have been framed  or  the  process\\n      has been issued.  but at that stage as there is no accused before  the\\n      court, such evidence can be used  only  to  corroborate  the  evidence\\n      recorded during the trial for the purpose of section 319  cr.p.c.,  if\\n      so required.52.   what is essential for the purpose of the section is  that  there\\n      should appear some evidence against a person not proceeded against and\\n      the stage of the proceedings is irrelevant. where the  complainant  is\\n      circumspect in proceeding against several persons, but the court is of\\n      the opinion that there appears to be some  evidence  pointing  to  the\\n      complicity of some other persons as well, section 319 cr.p.c. acts  as\\n      an empowering provision  enabling  the  court/magistrate  to  initiate\\n      proceedings against such other persons. the  purpose  of  section  319\\n      cr.p.c. is to do complete justice and to ensure that persons who ought\\n      to have been tried as well are also tried. therefore, there  does  not\\n      appear to be any difficulty in invoking powers of section 319  cr.p.c.\\n      at the stage of trial in a complaint case when  the  evidence  of  the\\n      complainant as well as his witnesses is being recorded.53.   thus, the application of the provisions of section 319  cr.p.c.,\\n      at  the  stage  of  inquiry  is  to  be  understood  in  its   correct\\n      perspective. the power under section 319 cr.p.c. can be exercised only\\n      on the basis of the evidence adduced before the court during a  trial.\\n      so far as its application during the course of inquiry  is  concerned,\\n      it remains limited as referred to hereinabove, adding a person  as  an\\n      accused, whose name has been mentioned in column 2 of the charge sheet\\n      or any other person who might be an accomplice.question no.(iii) : whether the word \"evidence\" used in section 319(1)\\n      cr.p.c. has been used  in  a  comprehensive  sense  and  includes  the\\n      evidence collected during investigation  or  the  word  \"evidence\"  is\\n      limited to the evidence recorded during trial?54.   to answer the questions and to resolve the  impediment  that  is\\n      being faced by the trial courts in exercising of powers under  section\\n      319 cr.p.c., the  issue  has  to  be  investigated  by  examining  the\\n      circumstances which give rise to a situation for the court  to  invoke\\n      such powers. the circumstances that lead to such inference being drawn\\n      up by the court for summoning a person arise out of  the  availability\\n      of the facts and material that comes up before the court and are  made\\n      the basis for summoning such a person as an accomplice to the  offence\\n      alleged to have been committed.   the  material  should  disclose  the\\n      complicity of the person in the commission of the offence which has to\\n      be the material that appears from the evidence during  the  course  of\\n      any inquiry into or trial of offence. the words as used in section 319\\n      cr.p.c. indicate that the material has to be “where ….it appears  from\\n      the evidence” before the court.55.   before we answer this issue, let us examine the meaning  of  the\\n      word  ‘evidence’.  according  to  section  3  of  the  evidence   act,\\n      ‘evidence’ means and includes:56.   according to tomlin’s law dictionary,  evidence  is  “the  means\\n      from which an inference may logically be drawn as to the existence  of\\n      a fact. it consists of proof by testimony of witnesses, on oath; or by\\n      writing or records.” bentham defines  ‘evidence’  as  “any  matter  of\\n      fact, the effect, tendency or design of which presented to mind, is to\\n      produce in the mind a persuasion  concerning  the  existence  of  some\\n      other  matter  of   fact-   a   persuasion   either   affirmative   or\\n      disaffirmative of its existence. of the two facts  so  connected,  the\\n      latter may be distinguished as the principal fact, and the  former  as\\n      the evidentiary fact.” according  to  wigmore  on  evidence,  evidence\\n      represents “any knowable fact or group of facts,  not  a  legal  or  a\\n      logical principle, considered with a view to its being offered  before\\n      a legal tribunal for the purpose of producing a  persuasion,  positive\\n      or negative, on the part of  the  tribunal,  as  to  the  truth  of  a\\n      proposition, not of law, or of logic, on which  the  determination  of\\n      the tribunal is to be asked.”57.    the  provision  and  the  above-mentioned  definitions  clearly\\n      suggest that it is an  exhaustive  definition.    wherever  the  words\\n      “means and include” are used, it is an indication of the fact that the\\n      definition ‘is a hard and fast definition’, and no other  meaning  can\\n      be assigned to the expression that is put down in the  definition.  it\\n      indicates an exhaustive explanation of

can  be\\n      used at the trial  only  for  contradictions  or  omissions  when  the\\n      witness is examined in the court.(see also: podda narayana & ors. v. state of a.p., air 1975  sc

sc 1892,  it was held\\n      that it is evident that a person, even though had initially been named\\n      in the fir as an accused, but not charge-sheeted, can also be added as\\n      an accused to face the trial. the trial court can take such a step  to\\n      add such persons as accused only on  the  basis  of  evidence  adduced\\n      before it and not on the basis of materials available in  the  charge-\\n      sheet or the case diary,  because  such  materials  contained  in  the\\n      charge-sheet or the case diary do not constitute evidence.62.   the majority view of the constitution bench in ramnarayan mor  &\\n      anr. v. the state of maharashtra, air 1964 sc 949 has been as under:63.   similarly, this court in sunil mehta & anr. v. state of  gujarat\\n      & anr., jt 2013 (3) sc 328, held  that  “it  is  trite  that  evidence\\n      within the meaning of the evidence act and so also within the  meaning\\n      of section\\xa0244 of the cr.p.c.  is  what  is  recorded  in  the  manner\\n      stipulated under section 138 in the case of oral evidence. documentary\\n      evidence would similarly be evidence only if the documents are  proved\\n      in the manner recognised and  provided  for  under  the  evidence  act\\n      unless of course a statutory provision makes the  document  admissible\\n      as evidence without any formal proof thereof.”64.   in guriya @ tabassum tauquir & ors. v. state of  bihar  &  anr.,\\n      air 2008 sc 95, this court held that in exercise of the  powers  under\\n      section 319 cr.p.c., the court can add a new accused only on the basis\\n      of evidence adduced before it  and  not  on  the  basis  of  materials\\n      available in the charge sheet or the case diary.65.   in kishun singh (supra),  this court held :66.   a similar view has been taken  by  this  court  in  raj  kishore\\n      prasad (supra), wherein it was held that in order to apply section 319\\n      cr.p.c., it is essential that the need to proceed against  the  person\\n      other than the accused appearing to be guilty of offence  arises  only\\n      on evidence recorded in the course of an inquiry or trial.67.   in lal suraj @ suraj singh & anr. v. state of jharkhand,  (2009)\\n      2 scc 696, a two-judge bench of this court held that “a court  framing\\n      a charge would have before it all the materials on record  which  were\\n      required to be proved by the prosecution. in a  case  where,  however,\\n      the court exercises its jurisdiction under section  319  cr.p.c.,  the\\n      power has to be exercised on the basis of the fresh  evidence  brought\\n      before the court. there lies a fine but clear distinction.”68.   a similar view has been reiterated by  this  court  in  rajendra\\n      singh v. state of u.p. & anr., air 2007 sc 2786, observing that  court\\n      should not exercise the power under section 319 cr.p.c. on  the  basis\\n      of materials available in the charge-sheet or the case diary,  because\\n      such materials contained in the charge-sheet or the case diary do  not\\n      constitute evidence.  the  word  ‘evidence’  in  section  319  cr.p.c.\\n      contemplates the evidence of witnesses given in the court.69.   ordinarily, it is only after the charges  are  framed  that  the\\n      stage of recording of evidence is reached. a bare perusal  of  section\\n      227 cr.p.c. would show that the legislature has used the terms “record\\n      of the case” and the “documents submitted therewith”. it  is  in  this\\n      context that the word ‘evidence’ as appearing in section  319  cr.p.c.\\n      has to be read and understood. the material collected at the stage  of\\n      investigation can at best be used for a limited  purpose  as  provided\\n      under  section  157  of  the  evidence  act  i.e.  to  corroborate  or\\n      contradict the statements of the witnesses recorded before the  court.\\n      therefore, for the exercise of power under section  319  cr.p.c.,  the\\n      use of word `evidence’ means material that has come before  the  court\\n      during an inquiry or trial by  it  and  not  otherwise.  if  from  the\\n      evidence led in the trial the court is of the opinion  that  a  person\\n      not accused before it has also committed the offence,  it  may  summon\\n      such person under section 319 cr.p.c.70.   with respect to documentary evidence, it is sufficient,  as  can\\n      be seen from a bare perusal of section 3 of the evidence act  as  well\\n      as the decision of the constitution bench, that a document is required\\n      to be produced and proved according to  law  to  be  called  evidence.\\n      whether  such  evidence  is  relevant,   irrelevant,   admissible   or\\n      inadmissible, is a matter of trial.71.   it is, therefore, clear that the word “evidence” in section  319\\n      cr.p.c. means only such evidence as  is  made  before  the  court,  in\\n      relation to statements, and as produced before the court, in  relation\\n      to documents. it is only such evidence that can be taken into  account\\n      by the magistrate or the court to decide whether power  under  section\\n      319 cr.p.c. is to be exercised  and  not  on  the  basis  of  material\\n      collected during investigation.72.   the  inquiry  by  the  court  is  neither  attributable  to  the\\n      investigation nor  the  prosecution,  but  by  the  court  itself  for\\n      collecting information to draw back a  curtain  that  hides  something\\n      material. it is the duty of the court to do so and therefore the power\\n      to perform this duty is provided under the cr.p.c.73.   the unveiling of facts other than the material collected  during\\n      investigation before the magistrate or  court  before  trial  actually\\n      commences is part of the process of inquiry. such facts when  recorded\\n      during trial are evidence. it is evidence only on  the  basis  whereof\\n      trial can be held, but can the same definition  be  extended  for  any\\n      other material collected during inquiry by the magistrate or court for\\n      the purpose of section 319 cr.p.c.?74.   an inquiry can be conducted by the magistrate or  court  at  any\\n      stage during the proceedings before the court. this power is preserved\\n      with the court and has to be  read  and  understood  accordingly.  the\\n      outcome of any such exercise should not be an impediment in the speedy\\n      trial of the case.75.   though the facts so received by the magistrate or the court  may\\n      not be evidence, yet it is some material that makes things  clear  and\\n      unfolds  concealed  or  deliberately  suppressed  material  that   may\\n      facilitate the trial. in the context of section 319 cr.p.c. it  is  an\\n      information of complicity. such material therefore, can be  used  even\\n      though not an evidence in stricto sensuo, but an information on record\\n      collected by the  court  during  inquiry  itself,  as  a  prima  facie\\n      satisfaction for exercising the powers as presently involved.76.   this pre-trial stage is a stage where  no  adjudication  on  the\\n      evidence of the offences involved takes place and therefore, after the\\n      material alongwith the charge-sheet has been brought before the court,\\n      the same can be inquired into in order  to  effectively  proceed  with\\n      framing of charges. after the charges are framed, the  prosecution  is\\n      asked to lead evidence and till that is done,  there  is  no  evidence\\n      available in the strict legal sense of section 3 of the evidence  act.\\n      the actual trial of the offence by bringing  the  accused  before  the\\n      court has still not begun. what is available is the material that  has\\n      been submitted before the court along with the charge-sheet.  in  such\\n      situation, the court only has the preparatory material that  has  been\\n      placed before the court for its consideration in order to proceed with\\n      the trial by framing of charges.77.   it is, therefore, not any material that can be utilised,  rather\\n      it is that material after cognizance is taken  by  a  court,  that  is\\n      available to it while making an inquiry into  or  trying  an  offence,\\n      that the court can utilize or take into consideration  for  supporting\\n      reasons to summon any person on the basis of evidence  adduced  before\\n      the court, who may be on the basis of such material, treated to be  an\\n      accomplice in the commission of the offence.  the inference  that  can\\n      be drawn is that material  which  is  not  exactly  evidence  recorded\\n      before the court, but is a material collected by  the  court,  can  be\\n      utilised to corroborate evidence already recorded for the  purpose  of\\n      summoning any other person, other than the accused.78.   this would harmonise such material with the word  ‘evidence’  as\\n      material  that  would  be  supportive  in  nature  to  facilitate  the\\n      exposition of any other accomplice whose complicity in the offence may\\n      have either been suppressed or escaped the notice of the court.79.   the word “evidence” therefore has to be understood in its  wider\\n      sense both at the stage of trial and, as discussed  earlier,  even  at\\n      the stage of inquiry, as used under section  319  cr.p.c.  the  court,\\n      therefore, should be understood to have the power to  proceed  against\\n      any person after summoning him on the basis of any  such  material  as\\n      brought forth before it.  the duty and obligation of the court becomes\\n      more onerous to invoke such powers cautiously on such  material  after\\n      evidence has been led during trial.80.   in  view  of  the  discussion  made  and  the  conclusion  drawn\\n      hereinabove, the answer to the aforesaid question posed is that  apart\\n      from evidence recorded  during  trial,  any  material  that  has  been\\n      received by the court after cognizance is taken and before  the  trial\\n      commences, can be utilised only for corroboration and to  support  the\\n      evidence recorded by the court to invoke the power under  section  319\\n      cr.p.c.  the ‘evidence’ is thus,  limited  to  the  evidence  recorded\\n      during trial.q.(ii)       does the word ‘evidence’ in section 319 cr.p.c. means  as\\n      arising  in  examination-in-chief  or  also   together   with   cross-\\n      examination?81.   the second question referred to herein is  in  relation  to  the\\n      word `evidence` as used under section 319  cr.p.c.,  which  leaves  no\\n      room for doubt that the evidence as understood under section 3 of  the\\n      evidence act is the statement  of  the  witnesses  that  are  recorded\\n      during trial and the  documentary  evidence  in  accordance  with  the\\n      evidence act, which also includes the document and  material  evidence\\n      in the evidence act.  such evidence begins with the statement  of  the\\n      prosecution witnesses,  therefore,  is  evidence  which  includes  the\\n      statement during examination-in-chief.  in rakesh (supra), it was held\\n      that “it is true that finally at the time of trial the accused  is  to\\n      be given an opportunity to  cross-examine  the  witness  to  test  its\\n      truthfulness. but that stage would  not  arise  while  exercising  the\\n      court’s power under section 319 crpc. once the deposition is recorded,\\n      no doubt there being no cross-examination, it would be a  prima  facie\\n      material which would enable  the  sessions  court  to  decide  whether\\n      powers under section 319 should be exercised or not.” in ranjit  singh\\n      (supra), this court held that “it is not necessary for  the  court  to\\n      wait until the entire evidence is collected,” for exercising the  said\\n      power. in mohd. shafi (supra), it was held that the pre-requisite  for\\n      exercise of power under section 319 cr.p.c. was  the  satisfaction  of\\n      the court to proceed against a  person  who  is  not  an  accused  but\\n      against whom evidence occurs, for which the court can even  wait  till\\n      the cross examination is over and that there would be no illegality in\\n      doing so. a similar view has been taken by a two-judge  bench  in  the\\n      case of harbhajan singh & anr. v. state of punjab & anr. (2009) 13 scc608. this court in hardeep singh (supra) seems  to  have  misread  the\\n      judgment in mohd.  shafi  (supra),  as  it  construed  that  the  said\\n      judgment laid down that for the exercise of power  under  section  319\\n      cr.p.c., the court has to necessarily wait till the witness  is  cross\\n      examined and  on  complete  appreciation  of  evidence,  come  to  the\\n      conclusion whether there is  a  need  to  proceed  under  section  319\\n      cr.p.c.82.   we have given our thoughtful consideration to the diverse  views\\n      expressed in the aforementioned cases.  once  examination-in-chief  is\\n      conducted, the statement becomes part of the record. it is evidence as\\n      per law and in the true sense, for at best, it may be  rebuttable.  an\\n      evidence  being  rebutted  or  controverted  becomes   a   matter   of\\n      consideration, relevance and belief, which is the stage of judgment by\\n      the court. yet it is evidence and it is material on the basis  whereof\\n      the court can come to a prima facie opinion as to complicity  of  some\\n      other person who may be connected with the offence.83.   as held in mohd. shafi (supra) and harbhajan singh (supra),  all\\n      that is required for the exercise  of  the  power  under  section  319\\n      cr.p.c. is that, it must appear to the court that  some  other  person\\n      also who is not facing the trial, may also have been involved  in  the\\n      offence. the pre-requisite for the exercise of this power  is  similar\\n      to the prima facie view which the magistrate must come to in order  to\\n      take cognizance of the offence. therefore, no straight-jacket  formula\\n      can and should be  laid  with  respect  to  conditions  precedent  for\\n      arriving at such an opinion and, if the magistrate/court is  convinced\\n      even on the basis of evidence appearing  in  examination-in-chief,  it\\n      can exercise the power under  section  319  cr.p.c.  and  can  proceed\\n      against such other person(s). it is essential to note that the section\\n      also uses the words ‘such person could be tried’ instead of should  be\\n      tried. hence, what is required is not to have  a  mini-trial  at  this\\n      stage by  having  examination  and  cross-examination  and  thereafter\\n      rendering a decision on the overt act of  such  person  sought  to  be\\n      added. in fact, it is this mini-trial that would affect the  right  of\\n      the person sought to be arraigned as an accused rather than not having\\n      any cross-examination at all, for in light of sub-section 4 of section\\n      319 cr.p.c., the person would be entitled to a fresh  trial  where  he\\n      would have all  the  rights  including  the  right  to  cross  examine\\n      prosecution witnesses and examine defence witnesses  and  advance  his\\n      arguments upon the same. therefore, even on the basis of  examination-\\n      in-chief, the court or the magistrate can proceed against a person  as\\n      long as the court is satisfied that  the  evidence  appearing  against\\n      such person is such that it prima  facie  necessitates  bringing  such\\n      person to face trial. in fact, examination-in-chief untested by  cross\\n      examination, undoubtedly in itself, is an evidence.84.   further, in our opinion, there does not seem  to  be  any  logic\\n      behind waiting till the cross-examination of the witness is  over.  it\\n      is to be kept in mind that at the time  of  exercise  of  power  under\\n      section 319 cr.p.c., the person sought to be arraigned as an  accused,\\n      is in no way participating in the trial. even if the cross-examination\\n      is to be taken into consideration, the person sought to  be  arraigned\\n      as an accused cannot cross examine the witness(s) prior to passing  of\\n      an order under section  319  cr.p.c.,  as  such  a  procedure  is  not\\n      contemplated by the cr.p.c. secondly, invariably the state  would  not\\n      oppose or object to naming of more persons as an accused as  it  would\\n      only help the prosecution in completing the chain of evidence,  unless\\n      the witness(s) is obliterating the  role  of  persons  already  facing\\n      trial.  more so, section 299  cr.p.c.  enables  the  court  to  record\\n      evidence in absence of the  accused  in  the  circumstances  mentioned\\n      therein.85.   thus, in view of the above, we hold that power under section 319\\n      cr.p.c. can be exercised at the stage of completion of examination  in\\n      chief and court does not need to wait till the said evidence is tested\\n      on cross-examination for it is the satisfaction of the court which can\\n      be gathered from the reasons recorded by  the  court,  in  respect  of\\n      complicity of some other  person(s),  not  facing  the  trial  in  the\\n      offence.q. (iv) what is the degree of satisfaction required for  invoking  the\\n      power under section 319 cr.p.c.?86.   section 319(1) cr.p.c. empowers the  court  to  proceed  against\\n      other persons who appear to  be  guilty  of  offence,  though  not  an\\n      accused before the court.the word “appear” means  “clear  to  the  comprehension”,  or  a\\n      phrase near to, if not synonymous with “proved”.  it imparts a  lesser\\n      degree of probability than proof.87.   in pyare lal bhargava v.\\xa0the state of  rajasthan,  air  1963  sc\\n      1094, a four-judge bench of this court was concerned with the  meaning\\n      of the word ‘appear’. the court held that the appropriate  meaning  of\\n      the  word  ‘appears’  is  ‘seems’.  it  imports  a  lesser  degree  of\\n      probability than proof.\\xa0in ram singh & ors.   v.  ram  niwas  &  anr.,\\n      (2009) 14 scc 25, a two-judge bench of this court was  again  required\\n      to examine the importance of the word ‘appear’  as  appearing  in  the\\n      section. the court held that for the fulfillment of the condition that\\n      it appears to the court that a person had committed  an  offence,  the\\n      court must satisfy  itself  about  the  existence  of  an  exceptional\\n      circumstance enabling it to exercise  an  extraordinary  jurisdiction.\\n      what is, therefore,  necessary  for  the  court  is  to  arrive  at  a\\n      satisfaction that the evidence adduced on behalf of  the  prosecution,\\n      if unrebutted, may lead to conviction of  the  persons  sought  to  be\\n      added as an accused in the case.88.   at the time of taking cognizance, the court has to see whether a\\n      prima facie case is made out to proceed against  the  accused.   under\\n      section 319 cr.p.c., though the test of prima facie case is the  same,\\n      the degree of satisfaction that is required is much stricter.  a  two-\\n      judge bench of this court in vikas v. state of  rajasthan,  2013  (11)\\n      scale 23, held that on the  objective  satisfaction  of  the  court  a\\n      person may be \\'arrested\\' or \\'summoned\\', as the  circumstances  of  the\\n      case may require, if it appears from the evidence that any such person\\n      not being the accused has committed an offence for which  such  person\\n      could be tried together with the already arraigned accused persons.89.   in rajendra singh (supra), the court observed:90.   in mohd. shafi (supra), this court held that it is evident  that\\n      before a court exercises its discretionary jurisdiction  in  terms  of\\n      section 319 cr.p.c., it must  arrive  at  a  satisfaction  that  there\\n      exists a possibility that the accused so summoned  in  all  likelihood\\n      would be convicted.91.   in sarabjit singh & anr. v. state of punjab & anr., air 2009  sc\\n      2792, while explaining the scope of section 319 cr.p.c.,  a  two-judge\\n      bench of this court observed:92.   in brindaban das &  ors. v. state of west bengal,  air  2009  sc\\n      1248, a two-judge bench of this court took a  similar  view  observing\\n      that the court is required to consider whether such evidence would  be\\n      sufficient to convict the person being  summoned.  since  issuance  of\\n      summons under section 319 cr.p.c. entails a de novo trial and a  large\\n      number of witnesses may have been examined  and  their  re-examination\\n      could prejudice the prosecution and delay the trial, the  trial  court\\n      has to exercise such discretion with great care and perspicacity.a similar view has been re-iterated by  this  court  in  michael\\n      machado & anr. v. central bureau of investigation & ors., air 2000  sc\\n      1127.93.   however, there is a series of cases  wherein  this  court  while\\n      dealing with the provisions of sections 227, 228, 239, 240,  241,  242\\n      and 245 cr.p.c., has consistently held that  the court at the stage of\\n      framing of the charge has to apply its mind to the question whether or\\n      not there is any ground for presuming the commission of an offence  by\\n      the accused.  the court has to see as to whether the material  brought\\n      on record reasonably connect the accused  with  the  offence.  nothing\\n      more is required to be enquired into. while dealing with the aforesaid\\n      provisions, the test of prima facie case is to be applied.  the  court\\n      has to find out whether the materials offered by the prosecution to be\\n      adduced as evidence are sufficient for the court  to  proceed  against\\n      the accused further.

sc 2583).94.   in dilawar babu kurane v. state of maharashtra, air 2002 sc 564,\\n      this court while dealing with the provisions of sections 227  and  228\\n      cr.p.c., placed a very heavy reliance on the earlier judgment of  this\\n      court in union of india v. prafulla kumar samal & anr.,  air  1979  sc\\n      366 and held that while  considering  the  question  of   framing  the\\n      charges, the court may weigh the evidence for the limited  purpose  of\\n      finding out whether or not a prima facie case against the accused  has\\n      been made out and whether  the  materials  placed  before  this  court\\n      disclose grave suspicion  against  the  accused  which  has  not  been\\n      properly explained.  in such an eventuality, the court is justified in\\n      framing the charges and proceeding with the trial.  the court  has  to\\n      consider the broad probabilities of the case, the total effect of  the\\n      evidence and the documents produced before the court but court  should\\n      not make a roving enquiry into the pros and cons  of  the  matter  and\\n      weigh evidence as if it is conducting a trial.95.   in suresh v. state of maharashtra, air 2001 sc 1375, this  court\\n      after taking note of the earlier judgments  in  niranjan  singh  karam\\n      singh punjabi v. jitendra bhimraj bijjaya, air 1990 sc 1962 and  state\\n      of maharashtra v. priya sharan maharaj,  air 1997  sc  2041,  held  as\\n      under:96.   similarly in state of bihar v. ramesh singh, air 1977  sc  2018,\\n      while dealing with the issue, this court held:97.   in palanisamy gounder & anr. v. state, represented by  inspector\\n      of police, (2005) 12 scc 327, this court deprecated  the  practice  of\\n      invoking the power under section 319 cr.p.c. just to conduct a fishing\\n      inquiry, as in that case, the trial court exercised that power just to\\n      find out the real truth, though there was no valid ground  to  proceed\\n      against the person summoned by the court.98.   power under section 319 cr.p.c. is a discretionary and an extra-\\n      ordinary power. it is to be exercised  sparingly  and  only  in  those\\n      cases where the circumstances of the case so warrant. it is not to  be\\n      exercised because the magistrate or  the  sessions  judge  is  of  the\\n      opinion that some other person may also be guilty of  committing  that\\n      offence. only where strong and cogent evidence occurs against a person\\n      from the evidence led before the  court  that  such  power  should  be\\n      exercised and not in a casual and cavalier manner.99.   thus, we hold that though only a  prima  facie  case  is  to  be\\n      established from the evidence led before  the  court  not  necessarily\\n      tested on the anvil of cross-examination, it  requires  much  stronger\\n      evidence than mere probability of his complicity. the test that has to\\n      be applied is one which is more than prima facie case as exercised  at\\n      the time of framing of charge, but short of satisfaction to an  extent\\n      that the evidence, if goes unrebutted, would lead  to  conviction.  in\\n      the absence of  such  satisfaction,  the  court  should  refrain  from\\n      exercising power under section 319 cr.p.c.  in section 319 cr.p.c. the\\n      purpose of providing if ‘it appears from the evidence that any  person\\n      not being the accused has committed any offence’  is  clear  from  the\\n      words “for  which  such  person  could  be  tried  together  with  the\\n      accused.”  the words used are not ‘for  which  such  person  could  be\\n      convicted’.  there is, therefore, no scope for the court acting  under\\n      section 319 cr.p.c. to form  any  opinion  as  to  the  guilt  of  the\\n      accused.q.(v)  in  what  situations  can  the  power  under  this  section  be\\n      exercised: not named in fir; named in the fir but  not  charge-sheeted\\n      or has been discharged?100.  in joginder singh & anr. v. state of punjab & anr., air 1979  sc\\n      339, a three-judge bench of  this  court  held  that  as  regards  the\\n      contention  that  the  phrase  “any  person  not  being  the  accused”\\n      occurring in section  319  cr.p.c.  excludes  from  its  operation  an\\n      accused who has been released by the police under section 169  cr.p.c.\\n      and has been shown in column 2 of the charge-sheet, the contention has\\n      merely to be rejected. the said expression clearly covers  any  person\\n      who is not being tried already by the court and the  very  purpose  of\\n      enacting such a provision like section 319 (1) cr.p.c.  clearly  shows\\n      that  even  persons  who  have  been  dropped  by  the  police  during\\n      investigation but against whom evidence showing their  involvement  in\\n      the offence comes before the criminal court, are included in the  said\\n      expression.101.  in anju chaudhary v. state of u.p. & anr., (2013) 6 scc  384,  a\\n      two-judge bench of this court held that even in the cases where report\\n      under section 173(2) cr.p.c. is filed in the court  and  investigation\\n      records the name of a person in column\\xa02, or even does  not  name  the\\n      person as an accused at all, the  court  in  exercise  of  its  powers\\n      vested under section 319 cr.p.c. can summon the person as  an  accused\\n      and even at that stage of summoning, no hearing is contemplated  under\\n      the law.102.  in suman v. state of rajasthan & anr., air 2010 sc 518,  a  two-\\n      judge bench of this court  observed  that  there  is  nothing  in  the\\n      language of this sub-section from which it  can  be  inferred  that  a\\n      person who is named in the fir or complaint, but against whom  charge-\\n      sheet is not filed by the police, cannot  be  proceeded  against  even\\n      though in the course of any inquiry into or trial of any offence,  the\\n      court finds that such person has committed an  offence  for  which  he\\n      could be tried together with the other accused. in lal suraj  (supra),\\n      a two-judge bench held  that  there  is  no  dispute  with  the  legal\\n      proposition that even if a person had not been charge-sheeted, he  may\\n      come within the purview  of  the  description  of  such  a  person  as\\n      contained in section 319 cr.p.c. a similar view had been taken in  lok\\n      ram  (supra), wherein it was held that a person, though had  initially\\n      been named in the fir as an accused, but not charge-sheeted, can  also\\n      be added to face the trial.103.  even the constitution bench in dharam pal (cb) has held that the\\n      sessions court can also exercise its original jurisdiction and  summon\\n      a person as an accused in case his name appears in  column  2  of  the\\n      chargesheet, once the case had been committed to it.  it means that  a\\n      person whose  name  does  not  appear  even  in  the  fir  or  in  the\\n      chargesheet or whose name appears in the fir and not in the main  part\\n      of the chargesheet but in column 2 and has not  been  summoned  as  an\\n      accused in exercise of the powers under section 193 cr.p.c. can  still\\n      be summoned by the court, provided the court  is  satisfied  that  the\\n      conditions provided in the said statutory provisions stand  fulfilled.104.  however, there is a great difference with regard to a person who\\n      has been discharged. a person who has  been  discharged  stands  on  a\\n      different  footing  than  a  person  who  was   never   subjected   to\\n      investigation or if subjected  to,  but  not  charge-sheeted.  such  a\\n      person has stood the stage  of  inquiry  before  the  court  and  upon\\n      judicial examination of the material collected  during  investigation;\\n      the court had come to the conclusion that there is not  even  a  prima\\n      facie case to proceed against such person.  generally,  the  stage  of\\n      evidence in trial is merely  proving  the  material  collected  during\\n      investigation and therefore, there is not much change as  regards  the\\n      material existing against the person so discharged.  therefore,  there\\n      must exist compelling circumstances to exercise such power. the  court\\n      should keep in mind that the witness when giving evidence against  the\\n      person so discharged, is not doing so merely to  seek  revenge  or  is\\n      naming him at the behest of  someone  or  for  such  other  extraneous\\n      considerations. the court has  to  be  circumspect  in  treating  such\\n      evidence and try to separate the chaff from the grain. if  after  such\\n      careful examination of the evidence, the court is of the opinion  that\\n      there does exist evidence to proceed against the person so discharged,\\n      it may take steps but only in  accordance  with  section  398  cr.p.c.\\n      without resorting to the provision of section 319 cr.p.c. directly.105.  in sohan lal & ors. v. state of rajasthan, (1990) 4 scc  580,  a\\n      two-judge bench of this court held  that  once  an  accused  has  been\\n      discharged, the procedure for  enquiry  envisaged  under  section  398\\n      cr.p.c. cannot be  circumvented  by  prescribing  to  procedure  under\\n      section 319 cr.p.c.106.  in municipal corporation of delhi v. ram kishan rohtagi &  ors.,\\n      air 1983 sc 67, this court held that if the  prosecution  can  at  any\\n      stage produce evidence which satisfies the court that those  who  have\\n      not been arraigned as accused or against whom  proceedings  have  been\\n      quashed,  have  also  committed  the  offence,  the  court  can   take\\n      cognizance against them under section 319 cr.p.c. and try  them  along\\n      with the other accused.107.  power under section 398 cr.p.c. is in the nature  of  revisional\\n      power which can be exercised only by the high court  or  the  sessions\\n      judge, as the case may be. according to section  300  (5)  cr.p.c.,  a\\n      person discharged under section 258 cr.p.c. shall not be  tried  again\\n      for the same offence except with the consent of the court by which  he\\n      was discharged or of any other  court  to  which  the  first-mentioned\\n      court is subordinate. further, section 398 cr.p.c. provides  that  the\\n      high court or  the  sessions  judge  may  direct  the  chief  judicial\\n      magistrate by himself or by any of the magistrate subordinate  to  him\\n      to make an inquiry into the case against any person  who  has  already\\n      been discharged.108.  both these provisions contemplate an  inquiry  to  be  conducted\\n      before any person, who has already been discharged, is asked to  again\\n      face trial if some evidence appears  against  him.  as  held  earlier,\\n      section 319 cr.p.c. can also be invoked at the stage of inquiry. we do\\n      not see any reason why  inquiry  as  contemplated  by  section  300(5)\\n      cr.p.c. and section 398 cr.p.c. cannot be an inquiry under section 319\\n      cr.p.c. accordingly, a person discharged can also be  arraigned  again\\n      as an accused but only after an inquiry as  contemplated  by  sections\\n      300(5) and 398 cr.p.c. if during or after such inquiry, there  appears\\n      to be an evidence against such person, power under section 319 cr.p.c.\\n      can be exercised. we may clarify that the word ‘trial’  under  section\\n      319 cr.p.c. would be eclipsed by virtue of above  provisions  and  the\\n      same cannot be invoked so far as a person discharged is concerned, but\\n      no more.109.  thus, it is evident that power under section 319 cr.p.c. can  be\\n      exercised against a person not subjected to investigation, or a person\\n      placed in the column 2 of the charge-sheet and against whom cognizance\\n      had not been taken, or a person  who  has  been  discharged.  however,\\n      concerning a person who has been discharged,  no  proceedings  can  be\\n      commenced against him  directly  under  section  319  cr.p.c.  without\\n      taking recourse to provisions of section 300(5) read with section  398\\n      cr.p.c.?110. we accordingly sum up our conclusions as follows:question nos.1 & iii\\n\\n      q.1 what is the stage at which power under section 319  cr.p.c. can be\\n      exercised?and\\n\\n      q.iii whether the word \"evidence\" used in section 319(1)  cr.p.c.  has\\n      been used in a comprehensive sense and includes the evidence collected\\n      during investigation or the word \"evidence\" is limited to the evidence\\n      recorded during trial?a. in dharam pal\\'s case, the constitution bench has already held  that\\n      after committal, cognizance of an  offence  can  be  taken  against  a\\n      person not  named  as  an  accused  but  against  whom  materials  are\\n      available from the papers filed by  the  police  after  completion  of\\n      investigation. such cognizance can be taken under section 193  cr.p.c.\\n      and the sessions judge need not wait till \\'evidence\\' under section 319\\n      cr.p.c. becomes available for summoning an additional accused.?      section 319 cr.p.c., significantly, uses  two  expressions  that\\n      have to be taken note of i.e.  (1)  inquiry  (2)  trial.  as  a  trial\\n      commences after framing of charge, an inquiry can only  be  understood\\n      to be a pre-trial inquiry. inquiries  under  sections  200,  201,  202\\n      cr.p.c.; and under section 398 cr.p.c.  are  species  of  the  inquiry\\n      contemplated by section 319 cr.p.c. materials coming before the  court\\n      in course of such enquiries can  be  used  for  corroboration  of  the\\n      evidence recorded in the court after  the  trial  commences,  for  the\\n      exercise of power under section  319  cr.p.c.,  and  also  to  add  an\\n      accused whose name has been shown in column 2 of the chargesheet.in view of the above position the word \\'evidence\\' in section 319\\n      cr.p.c. has to  be  broadly  understood  and  not  literally  i.e.  as\\n      evidence brought during a trial.question no. ii\\n\\n      q.ii whether the word \"evidence\" used in section 319(1) cr.p.c.  could\\n      only mean evidence  tested  by  cross-examination  or  the  court  can\\n      exercise the power under the said provision even on the basis  of  the\\n      statement made in the examination-in-chief of the witness concerned??a. considering the fact  that  under  section  319  cr.p.c.  a  person\\n      against whom material is disclosed is only summoned to face the  trial\\n      and in such an event  under  section  319(4)  cr.p.c.  the  proceeding\\n      against such person is  to  commence  from  the  stage  of  taking  of\\n      cognizance, the court need not  wait  for  the  evidence  against  the\\n      accused proposed to be summoned to be tested by cross-examination.question no. iv\\n\\n      q.iv what is the nature of the satisfaction  required  to  invoke  the\\n      power under section 319 cr.p.c. to arraign  an  accused?  whether  the\\n      power under section 319 (1) cr.p.c. can be exercised only if the court\\n      is satisfied that the accused  summoned  will  in  all  likelihood  be\\n      convicted?a. though under section 319(4)(b)  cr.p.c.  the  accused  subsequently\\n      impleaded is to be treated as if he had been an accused when the court\\n      initially took cognizance of the offence, the degree  of  satisfaction\\n      that will be required for summoning a person under section 319 cr.p.c.\\n      would be the same as for ?framing  a  charge.  the  difference  in  the\\n      degree of satisfaction  for  summoning  the  original  accused  and  a\\n      subsequent accused is on account of the fact that the trial  may  have\\n      already commenced against the original accused and it is in the course\\n      of such trial that materials are disclosed against the newly  summoned\\n      accused. fresh summoning of an accused will result  in  delay  of  the\\n      trial - therefore the degree of satisfaction for summoning the accused\\n      (original and subsequent) has to be different.question no.v\\n\\n      q.v does the power under section 319 cr.p.c.  extend  to  persons  not\\n      named in the fir or named in the fir but not chargesheeted or who have\\n      been discharged?a.    a person not named in the fir or a person though  named  in  the\\n      fir but has not been chargesheeted or a person who has been discharged\\n      can be summoned under section 319 cr.p.c. provided from  the  evidence\\n      it appears that such person  can  be  tried  along  with  the  accused\\n      already facing trial. however, in so far as an accused  who  has  been\\n      discharged is concerned the  requirement  of  ?sections  300  and   398\\n      cr.p.c. has to be complied with before he can be summoned afresh.the matters be placed before the  appropriate  bench  for  final\\n      disposal in accordance with law explained hereinabove.….………………...................cji.(p. sathasivam)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                   .….………………......................j.(dr. b.s. chauhan)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n

       "'dr bs chauhan j   this reference before us arises out of a variety of views  having      been expressed by this court and several high courts of the country on      the scope and extent of the powers of the courts  under  the  criminal      justice system to arraign any person as an accused during  the  course      of inquiry or trial as contemplated under section  of the  code  of      criminal procedure  hereinafter referred to as the crpc    the initial reference was made by a twojudge bench  vide  order      dated  in the leading case of hardeep singh crl appeal  no       of   where noticing the conflict between  the  judgments  in      the case of rakesh v state of haryana air  sc  and  a  two      judge bench decision in the case of mohd shafi v mohd rafiq  anr      air  sc  a doubt was expressed about the correctness  of  the      view in the case of mohd shafi  the doubts as categorised  in      paragraphs  and  of the reference order led to the framing of  two      questions by the said bench which are reproduced hereunder    the reference was desired to be resolved by a threejudge  bench      whereafter the same came up for consideration  and  vide  order  dated       the court opined that in view of the reference made in  the      case of dharam pal  ors v state of haryana  anr   scc       the issues involved being identical in  nature  the  same  should  be      resolved by a constitution bench consisting of at least  five  judges      the bench felt that since a threejudge bench has already referred the      matter of dharam pal  to a constitution  bench  then  in  that      event it would be appropriate that such overlapping issues should also      be resolved by a bench of similar strength    reference made in the case of dharam  pal    came  to  be      answered in relation to the power of a court  of  sessions  to  invoke      section  crpc at the stage of committal of the case to  a  court      of sessions the said reference was answered by the constitution bench      in the case of dharam pal  ors v state of haryana  anr air        sc  hereinafter called dharam pal  wherein  it  was  held      that a court of sessions can with  the  aid  of  section    crpc      proceed to array any other person and summon him for being tried  even      if the provisions of section   crpc  could  not  be  pressed  in      service at the stage of committalthus after the reference was made by a threejudge bench in the      present case the powers so far as the court of sessions is concerned      to invoke section    crpc  at  the  stage  of  committal  stood      answered finally in the aforesaid background    on the consideration of the submissions raised and  in  view  of      what has been noted above the following questions are to be  answered      by this bench    in this reference what we are primarily concerned with  is  the      stage at which such powers can be invoked and secondly the  material      on the basis whereof the invoking of such powers can be justified  to      add as a corollary to the same thirdly  the  manner  in  which  such      power has to be exercised also has to be considered   the constitutional mandate  under  articles    and    of  the      constitution  of  india    hereinafter  referred   to   as   the      constitution  provides  a  protective  umbrella  for   the   smooth      administration of justice making adequate provisions to ensure a  fair      and efficacious trial so that the  accused  does  not  get  prejudiced      after the law has been put into motion to try him for the offence  but      at the same time also gives equal protection to  victims  and  to  the      society at large to ensure that the guilty does not get away from  the      clutches of law  for the empowerment of the courts to ensure that the      criminal  administration  of  justice  works  properly  the  law  was      appropriately codified and  modified  by  the  legislature  under  the      crpc indicating as to how the courts should  proceed  in  order  to      ultimately find out the  truth  so  that  an  innocent  does  not  get      punished but at the same time the guilty are brought  to  book  under      the law it is these ideals as enshrined under  the  constitution  and      our laws that  have  led  to  several  decisions  whereby  innovating      methods and progressive tools have been forged to find  out  the  real      truth and to ensure that the   guilty  does  not  go  unpunished  the      presumption of innocence is the general law of the land as  every  man      is presumed to be innocent unless proven to be guilty   alternatively certain  statutory  presumptions  in  relation  to      certain class of offences have been raised against the accused whereby      the presumption of guilt prevails  till  the  accused  discharges  his      burden upon an onus being cast upon him under the law to prove himself      to be innocent  these competing theories have been kept  in  mind  by      the legislature the entire effort therefore is  not  to  allow  the      real perpetrator of an offence to get away unpunished this is also  a      part of fair trial and in our opinion in order to achieve  this  very      end that the  legislature  thought  of  incorporating   provisions  of      section  crpc    it is with the said object  in  mind  that  a  constructive  and      purposive interpretation should be adopted that advances the cause  of      justice and does not dilute the intention of  the  statute  conferring      powers on the court to carry out the above mentioned avowed object and      purpose to try the person to the  satisfaction  of  the  court  as  an      accomplice in the commission of the offence that is subject matter  of      trial  in order to answer the aforesaid  questions  posed  it  will  be      appropriate to refer to section  of the  criminal  procedure  code       hereinafter referred to  as  old  code  where  an  analogous      provision existed empowering the court to  summon  any  person  other      than the accused if he is found to be connected with the commission of      the offence however when the new crpc was being  drafted  regard      was had to st  report of the law commission where in the  paragraphs       and  recommendations were made to make this provision  more      comprehensive the said recommendations read   section  crpc as it exists today is quoted hereunder   section  crpc springs out of the doctrine  judex  damnatur      cum nocens absolvitur judge is condemned when  guilty  is  acquitted      and this doctrine must be used as a beacon light while explaining  the      ambit and the spirit underlying the enactment of section  crpcit is the duty of the court to do justice by punishing the  real      culprit where the investigating agency for any reason does not  array      one of the real culprits as an accused the court is not powerless  in      calling the said accused to face trial  the  question  remains  under      what circumstances and at what stage should  the  court  exercise  its      power as contemplated in section  crpcthe submissions that were raised before us covered a  very  wide      canvas  and  the  learned  counsel  have  taken  us  through   various      provisions of crpc and the judgments that have been relied  on  for      the said purpose the controversy centers around the  stage  at  which      such powers can be invoked by the court and the material on the  basis      whereof such powers can be exercised   it would be necessary to put on record that the power  conferred      under section  crpc is only on the courtthis has to be  understood  in  the  context  that  section        crpc empowers only the court to proceed against  such  person  the      word court in our hierarchy of  criminal  courts  has  been  defined      under section   crpc  which  includes  the  courts  of  sessions      judicial magistrates metropolitan magistrates as  well  as  executive      magistrates the court of sessions is defined in section  crpc and      the courts of judicial magistrates has been defined under  section        thereof  the courts of  metropolitan  magistrates  has  been  defined      under section  crpc the courts which can try  offences  committed      under the indian penal code  or any offence under any other  law      have been specified under section  crpc read with first schedule      the explanatory note   under  the  heading  of  classification  of      offences  under  the  first   schedule   specifies   the   expression      magistrate  of  first  class  and  any   magistrate   to   include      metropolitan magistrates who are empowered to try the  offences  under      the said schedule but excludes executive magistrates   it is at this stage the  comparison  of  the  words  used  under      section  crpc has to be understood distinctively from  the  word      used under section  defining an inquiry other than the trial by  a      magistrate or a court here the legislature has used two words namely      the magistrate  or  court  whereas  under  section    crpc  as      indicated above only the word court has  been  recited   this  has      been done by the legislature to emphasise that the power under section       crpc is exercisable only by the court and not  by  any  officer      not acting as  a  court  thus  the  magistrate  not  functioning  or      exercising powers as  a  court  can  make  an  inquiry  in  particular      proceeding other than a trial but the material so collected would  not      be by a court during  the  course  of  an  inquiry  or  a  trial  the      conclusion therefore in short is that in order to invoke  the  power      under section  crpc it is only a court of sessions or  a  court      of  magistrate performing the duties as a court under the crpc that      can utilise the material  before  it  for  the  purpose  of  the  said      section   section  crpc allows the  court  to  proceed  against  any      person who is not an accused in a case before it   thus  the  person      against whom summons are issued in exercise of  such  powers  has  to      necessarily not be an accused already facing trial he can either be a      person named in column  of the chargesheet filed  under  section        crpc or a person whose name has  been  disclosed  in  any  material      before the court that is to be considered for the  purpose  of  trying      the offence but not  investigated  he  has  to  be  a  person  whose      complicity may be indicated and connected with the commission  of  the      offence   the legislature cannot be presumed  to  have  imagined  all  the      circumstances and therefore it is the duty of the court to give full      effect to the words used by the legislature so  as  to  encompass  any      situation which the court may have to tackle while proceeding  to  try      an offence and not allow a person who deserves to be tried to go  scot      free by being not arraigned in the trial in spite  of  possibility  of      his complicity which can be gathered from the documents  presented  by      the prosecution   the court is the sole repository of justice and a duty  is  cast      upon it to  uphold  the  rule  of  law  and  therefore  it  will  be      inappropriate to deny the existence of such powers with the courts  in      our criminal justice system where it is not  uncommon  that  the  real      accused at times get away by manipulating the  investigating  andor      the prosecuting agency  the desire to avoid trial is so  strong  that      an accused makes efforts at times to get himself absolved even at  the      stage of investigation or inquiry even though he may be connected with      the commission of the offence  coming to the stage at which power under section  crpc  can      be exercised in dharam  pal    this  court  had  noticed  the      conflict in the decisions of kishun singh  ors  v  state  of  bihar        scc  and ranjit singh v state of punjab air  sc       and referred the matter to the  constitution  bench   however  while      referring the matter to a constitution bench this court affirmed  the      judgment in kishun singh  and doubted the  correctness  of  the      judgment in ranjit singh  in ranjit singh  this  court      observed that from the stage of  committal  till  the  sessions  court      reaches the stage indicated in section   crpc  that  court  can      deal with only the accused referred to  in  section    crpc  and      there is no intermediary stage till then for the sessions court to add      any other person to the array of the accused while  in  kishun  singh       this court came to the  conclusion  that  even  the  sessions      court has power under section  crpc to take  cognizance  of  the      offence and summon other persons whose complicity in the commission of      the trial can prima facie be gathered from the materials available  on      record and need not wait till the stage  of  section    crpc  is      reached this court in dharam pal   held  that  the  effect  of      ranjit singh  would be that in less serious offences triable by      a magistrate the said court would have the power to  proceed  against      those who are mentioned in column  of the  chargesheet  if  on  the      basis of  material  on  record  the  magistrate  disagrees  with  the      conclusion reached by the police but  as  far  as  serious  offences      triable by the court of sessions are concerned that court  will  have      to wait till the stage of section  crpc is reached   at the very outset we may explain that the issue that was being      considered by this court in  dharam pal  was the exercise of such      power at the stage of committal of a case and the court held that even      if section  crpc could not be invoked at that stage section       crpc could be invoked for the said purpose we are not delving into      the said issue which had been answered by the fivejudge bench of this      court however we may clarify that the opening words of  section        crpc categorically recite that the power of the court  of  sessions      to take cognizance would commence only after committal of the case  by      a magistrate the said provision  opens  with  a  nonobstante  clause      except as otherwise expressly provided by this code or by  any  other      law for the time being in force the section therefore  is  clarified      by the said opening words which clearly means that  if  there  is  any      other provision  under  crpc  expressly  making  a  provision  for      exercise of powers by the court to  take  cognizance  then  the  same      would apply and the provisions of section   crpc  would  not  be      applicable   in our opinion section  crpc  is  an  enabling  provision      empowering the court to take appropriate steps for proceeding  against      any person not being an accused for also having committed the  offence      under trial  it is this part which is  under  reference  before  this      court and therefore in  our  opinion  while  answering  the  question      referred to herein we do not find any conflict so as  to  delve  upon      the situation that was dealt by this court in dharam pal    in elachuri venkatachinnayya  ors v kingemperor    ilr       mad  this court held that an inquiry  is  a  stage  before  the      committal to a higher court in fact from a careful  reading  of  the      judgments under reference ie ranjit singh  and  kishun  singh       it emerges that there is no dispute even in these  two  cases      that the stage of committal is neither an inquiry nor a trial for  in      both the cases the real dispute was whether section   crpc  can      be invoked at the time of committal to summon an accused to face trial      who is not already an accused it can safely be  said  that  both  the      cases are in harmony as to the said stage neither  being  a  stage  of      inquiry nor a trial   once the aforesaid stand is clarified in relation to  the  stage      of committal before the court of sessions the answer to the  question      posed now stands focussed only on the stage at which such powers  can      be exercised by the court other than the stage of  committal  and  the      material on the basis whereof such powers can be invoked by the courtquestion no what is the stage at which  power  under  section        crpc can be exercised   the stage of inquiry and trial upon cognizance being taken of an      offence has been considered by a large number of  decisions  of  this      court and that it may be useful to  extract  the  same  hereunder  for      proper appreciation of the stage  of  invoking  of  the  powers  under      section  crpc to understand the meaning that can  be  attributed      to the word inquiry and trial as used under the section   in raghubans dubey v state of bihar air    sc    this      court held    the  stage  of  inquiry  commences  insofar  as  the  court  is      concerned with the filing of the chargesheet and  the  consideration      of the material collected by the prosecution that is mentioned in the      chargesheet for the purpose of trying the accused  this  has  to  be      understood in terms of section  crpc which defines an  inquiry      as follows  inquiry  means  every  inquiry  other  than  a  trial           conducted under this code by a magistrate or court   in state of up v lakshmi brahman  anr  air    sc        this court held that from the  stage  of  filing  of  chargesheet  to      ensuring the compliance of provision  of  section     crpc  the      court is only at the stage of inquiry and no trial can be said to have      commenced the above view has been held to  be  per  incurium  in  raj      kishore prasad v state of bihar  anr air    sc    wherein      this court while observing that section   crpc operates in an      ongoing inquiry into or trial of an offence held that at the  stage      of section  crpc the court is neither at the stage  of  inquiry      nor at the stage of trial even at the stage of ensuring compliance of      sections  and  crpc it cannot be said that the court  is  at      the stage of inquiry because there is no judicial application of  mind      and all that the magistrate is required to do  is  to  make  the  case      ready to be heard by the court of sessions   trial is distinct from an inquiry and must  necessarily  succeed      it the purpose of the trial is to fasten the  responsibility  upon  a      person on the basis of  facts  presented  and  evidence  led  in  this      behalf in moly  anr v state of kerala  air    sc    this      court observed that though the word trial  is  not  defined  in  the      code it is clearly distinguishable from inquiry inquiry must  always      be a forerunner to the trial a threejudge bench of this court in the      state of bihar vram naresh pandey  anr air  sc  held   in ratilal

cause a registered society  thr  its  director  v      union of india  ors air  sc  this court while dealing with      the issue held   in raj kishore prasad  this court said that as  soon  as      the prosecutor is present before the court and that  court  hears  the      parties on framing of charges and discharge trial  is  said  to  have      commenced and that there is no intermediate stage between committal of      case and framing of charge   in in re narayanaswamy naidu v unknown  ind cas   a  full      bench of the madras high court  held  that   trial  begins  when  the      accused is charged and called on  to  answer  and  then  the  question      before the court  is  whether  the  accused  is  to  be  acquitted  or      convicted and not whether the complaint is  to  be  dismissed  or  the      accused discharged a similar view has  been  taken  by  madras  high      court subsequently in sriramulu v  veerasalingam    ilr        mad    however the bombay high court in dagdu govindshet wani v punja      vedu wani   bomlr  referring to sriramulu   held      empress  ilr  cal  that is to say   trial  has           always been understood to mean the  proceeding  which  commences           when the case is called on with the magistrate on the bench the           accused in the dock and the representatives of  the  prosecution           and defence if the accused be defended present in  court  for           the hearing of the case           a similar view has been taken by the lahore high court in  sahib      din v the crown  ilr  lah  wherein it was  held  that      for the purposes of section  of the code a trial cannot be said to      commence only when a charge is framed the trial covers the  whole  of      the  proceedings  in  a  warrant  case  this  case  was  followed  in      fakhruddin v the crown  ilr  lah  and in labhsing  v      emperor   crl j    in view of the above the law can be summarised  to  the  effect      that as trial means determination of issues adjudging the  guilt  or      the innocence of a person the person has to be aware of what  is  the      case against him and it is only at the stage of framing of the charges      that the court informs him of the same the trial commences only  on      charges being framed thus we do not approve the view  taken  by  the      courts that in a criminal case trial commences  on  cognizance  being      taken   section  crpc  and  the  case  laws  referred  to  above      therefore clearly envisage inquiry before the actual commencement  of      the trial and is an act conducted under crpc by the magistrate  or      the court the word inquiry is therefore not any inquiry  relating      to the investigation of the case by the investigating agency but is an      inquiry after the case is brought to the notice of the  court  on  the      filing of the chargesheet  the court can thereafter proceed to  make      inquiries and it is for this reason that an inquiry has been given  to      mean something other than the actual trial    even the  word  course  occurring  in  section    crpc      clearly indicates that the power can  be  exercised  only  during  the      period when the inquiry has been commenced and  is  going  on  or  the      trial which has commenced and is going on  it  covers the entire wide      range of the process of the pretrial and the trial stage   the  word      course therefore allows the court to invoke this power  to  proceed      against any person from the initial stage of inquiry upto the stage of      the conclusion of the  trial   the  court  does  not  become  functus      officio even if cognizance is taken so far as it is looking  into  the      material qua any other  person  who  is  not  an  accused   the  word      course ordinarily conveys a meaning of a  continuous  progress  from      one point to the next in time and conveys the  idea  of  a  period  of      time duration and not a fixed point of time  see  commissioner  of      incometax new delhi now rajasthan  v  ms  east  west  import        export  ltd now known as asian  distributors  ltd  jaipur  air       sc    in a somewhat similar manner it has  been  attributed  to  word      course the meaning of being a gradual and continuous  flow  advanced      by journey or passage from one place  to  another  with  reference  to      period of time when the  movement  is  in  progress  see  state  of      travancorecochin  ors v shanmugha vilas cashewnut factory quilon      air  sc    to say that powers under section  crpc  can  be  exercised      only during trial would be reducing the impact of the  word  inquiry      by the court  it is a settled principle of law that an interpretation      which leads to the conclusion that a word used by the  legislature  is      redundant  should  be  avoided  as  the  presumption  is   that   the      legislature has  deliberately  and  consciously  used  the  words  for      carrying out the purpose of the act the legal maxim a  verbis  legis      non est recedendum which means from the words of law there must be      no departure has to be kept in mind   the court cannot proceed with an assumption that the legislature      enacting the statute has committed a mistake and where the language of      the statute is plain and unambiguous the court cannot go  behind  the      language of the statute so as to add or subtract a  word  playing  the      role of a political reformer or of a wise counsel to the  legislature      the court has to proceed on the footing that the legislature  intended      what it has said and even if there is some defect in  the  phraseology      etc it is for others than the  court  to  remedy  that  defect  the      statute requires to be interpreted without doing any violence  to  the      language used therein the court cannot rewrite  recast  or  reframe      the legislation for the reason that it has no power to legislate   no word in a statute has to be construed as surplusage no  word      can be rendered ineffective or purposeless  courts  are  required  to      carry  out  the  legislative  intent  fully  and   completely   while      construing a provision full effect is to be  given  to  the  language      used therein giving reference to the context and other provisions  of      the statute by construction a provision should not be reduced  to  a      dead letter or useless lumber an interpretation which  renders  a      provision an otiose should be avoided otherwise it would mean that  in      enacting such  a  provision  the  legislature  was  involved  in  an      exercise in futility and the product came as a purposeless piece of      legislation and that  the  provision  had  been  enacted  without  any      purpose and the entire exercise to enact such a  provision  was  most      unwarranted  besides  being  uncharitable  vide  patel   chunibhai      dajibha etc v

inquiry is not surpulsage in the said provision   since after the filing of the chargesheet  the  court  reaches      the stage of inquiry and as soon as the court frames the charges  the      trial commences and therefore the power under section  crpc      can be exercised at any time  after  the  chargesheet  is  filed  and      before the pronouncement of  judgment  except  during  the  stage  of      section  crpc committal etc which  is  only  a  pretrial      stage intended to put the process into motion this stage  cannot  be      said to be a judicial step in the true sense for it only  requires  an      application of mind rather than a judicial application of mind   at this pretrial stage the magistrate is required  to  perform      acts in the nature of administrative work rather than judicial such as      ensuring compliance of sections  and   crpc  and  committing      the matter if it is exclusively triable by sessions court  therefore      it would be legitimate for us to conclude that the magistrate  at  the      stage of   sections   to    crpc  is  forbidden  by  express      provision of section  crpc to apply his mind to the  merits  of      the case and determine as to whether any accused needs to be added  or      subtracted to face trial before the court of sessions   it may be pertinent to refer to the decision in the case of  raj      kishore prasad  where in order to avoid any  delay  in  trial      the court emphasised that such a power should be exercised keeping  in      view the context in which the words inquiry and  trial  have  been      used under section  crpc and came to the conclusion that such  a      power is not available at the pretrial stage and  should  be  invoked      only at the stage of inquiry or after evidence is recorded   a twojudge bench of this court in ms swil ltd  v  state  of      delhi  anr  air  sc  held that once the process  has  been      issued power under section  crpc  cannot  be  exercised  as  at      that stage since it is neither an inquiry nor a trialin ranjit singh  the court held so from the stage of committal till the sessions court  reaches           the stage indicated in section  of the code that  court  can           deal with only the accused referred to in  section    of  the           code there is no intermediary stage till then for the  sessions           court to add any other person  to  the  array  of  the  accused           thus once the sessions court takes cognizance  of  the  offence           pursuant to the committal order the only other stage  when  the           court is empowered to add any other person to the array  of  the           accused is after reaching evidence collection when powers  under           section  of the code can be invoked   in  kishun  singh    the  court  while  considering  the      provision of the old code the law commissions recommendation and the      provisions in the  crpc  held  that  section    crpc  is  an      improved provision upon the earlier one it has removed the difficulty      of taking cognizance as cognizance against the added person  would  be      deemed to have been taken as originally against the other  coaccused      therefore on magistrate committing the case under section  crpc      to the court of sessions the bar of section  crpc  gets  lifted      thereby investing  the  court  of  sessions  complete  and  unfettered      jurisdiction of the court of original jurisdiction to take  cognizance      of the offence which would include the  summoning  of  the  person  or      persons whose complicity in the commission  of  the  crime  can  prima      facie be gathered from the material available on record though who is      not an accused before the court   in dharam pal  the constitution bench approved the decision      in kishun singh  that the sessions judge has original power  to      summon accused holding that the sessions judge was entitled to  issue      summons under sectioncode of criminal  procedure  upon  the  case      being committed to him by the magistrate the key words in section       are that no court of session shall take cognizance of any offence  as      a court of original jurisdiction unless the case has been committed to      it by a magistrate under this code the above provision entails  that      a case must first of all be committed to the court of session by the      magistrate the second condition is that only after the case had  been      committed to it could the court of session  take  cognizance  of  the      offence exercising original jurisdiction  although  an  attempt  has      been   made   to   suggest   that   the   cognizance   indicated    in      sectiondeals not with  cognizance  of  an  offence  but  of  the      commitment order passed by the learned magistrate we are not inclined      to accept such a submission in the clear wordings of section  that      the court of session may take cognizance of  the  offences  under  the      said section   it is thus aptly clear that until  and unless the  case  reaches      the stage of inquiry or trial by the court the  power  under  section       crpc cannot be exercised in fact this  proposition  does  not      seem to have been disturbed by the constitution bench  in  dharam  pal       the dispute therein was resolved visualizing a situation wherein      the court was concerned with procedural delay and was of  the  opinion      that the sessions court should not necessarily wait till the stage  of      section  crpc is reached to direct a person not  facing  trial      to appear and face trial as an accused we are in full agreement  with      the interpretation given by the constitution bench  that  section        crpc confers power of original jurisdiction upon the sessions court      to add an accused once the case has been committed to it   in our opinion the stage of inquiry does  not  contemplate  any      evidence in its strict legal sense nor  the  legislature  could  have      contemplated this inasmuch as the  stage  for  evidence  has  not  yet      arrived  the only material that  the  court  has  before  it  is  the      material collected by the prosecution and  the  court  at  this  stage      prima facie can apply its mind to find out as to whether a person who      can be an accused has been erroneously omitted from  being  arraigned      or has been deliberately excluded by the prosecuting  agencies   this      is all the more necessary in order to ensure  that  the  investigating      and the prosecuting agencies have acted fairly in bringing before  the      court those persons who deserve to be tried and to prevent any  person      from being deliberately shielded when they ought to have  been  tried      this is necessary to usher faith in the judicial  system  whereby  the      court should be empowered to exercise such powers even at the stage of      inquiry and it is for this reason that the legislature has consciously      used separate terms namely inquiry or trial in section  crpcaccordingly we hold that the court can exercise the power under      section  crpc only after the trial proceeds and  commences  with      the recording of the evidence and also in exceptional circumstances as      explained herein above   there is yet another  set  of  provisions  which  form  part  of      inquiry  relevant  for  the  purposes  of  section    crpc  ie      provisions of sections    etc crpc applicable  in  the      case of complaint cases as has been discussed herein evidence  means      evidence adduced before the  court  complaint  cases  is  a  distinct      category of criminal trial where some sort of evidence in  the  strict      legal sense of section    of  the  evidence  act    hereinafter      referred to as the evidence act comes before the court  there does      not seem to be any  restriction  in  the  provisions  of  section        crpc so as to preclude such evidence as coming before the court  in      complaint cases even before charges have been framed  or  the  process      has been issued  but at that stage as there is no accused before  the      court such evidence can be used  only  to  corroborate  the  evidence      recorded during the trial for the purpose of section   crpc  if      so required   what is essential for the purpose of the section is  that  there      should appear some evidence against a person not proceeded against and      the stage of the proceedings is irrelevant where the  complainant  is      circumspect in proceeding against several persons but the court is of      the opinion that there appears to be some  evidence  pointing  to  the      complicity of some other persons as well section  crpc acts  as      an empowering provision  enabling  the  courtmagistrate  to  initiate      proceedings against such other persons the  purpose  of  section        crpc is to do complete justice and to ensure that persons who ought      to have been tried as well are also tried therefore there  does  not      appear to be any difficulty in invoking powers of section   crpc      at the stage of trial in a complaint case when  the  evidence  of  the      complainant as well as his witnesses is being recorded   thus the application of the provisions of section   crpc      at  the  stage  of  inquiry  is  to  be  understood  in  its   correct      perspective the power under section  crpc can be exercised only      on the basis of the evidence adduced before the court during a  trial      so far as its application during the course of inquiry  is  concerned      it remains limited as referred to hereinabove adding a person  as  an      accused whose name has been mentioned in column  of the charge sheet      or any other person who might be an accomplicequestion no  whether the word evidence used in section       crpc has been used  in  a  comprehensive  sense  and  includes  the      evidence collected during investigation  or  the  word  evidence  is      limited to the evidence recorded during trial   to answer the questions and to resolve the  impediment  that  is      being faced by the trial courts in exercising of powers under  section       crpc the  issue  has  to  be  investigated  by  examining  the      circumstances which give rise to a situation for the court  to  invoke      such powers the circumstances that lead to such inference being drawn      up by the court for summoning a person arise out of  the  availability      of the facts and material that comes up before the court and are  made      the basis for summoning such a person as an accomplice to the  offence      alleged to have been committed   the  material  should  disclose  the      complicity of the person in the commission of the offence which has to      be the material that appears from the evidence during  the  course  of      any inquiry into or trial of offence the words as used in section       crpc indicate that the material has to be where it appears  from      the evidence before the court   before we answer this issue let us examine the meaning  of  the      word  evidence  according  to  section    of  the  evidence   act      evidence means and includes   according to tomlins law dictionary  evidence  is  the  means      from which an inference may logically be drawn as to the existence  of      a fact it consists of proof by testimony of witnesses on oath or by      writing or records bentham defines  evidence  as  any  matter  of      fact the effect tendency or design of which presented to mind is to      produce in the mind a persuasion  concerning  the  existence  of  some      other  matter  of   fact   a   persuasion   either   affirmative   or      disaffirmative of its existence of the two facts  so  connected  the      latter may be distinguished as the principal fact and the  former  as      the evidentiary fact according  to  wigmore  on  evidence  evidence      represents any knowable fact or group of facts  not  a  legal  or  a      logical principle considered with a view to its being offered  before      a legal tribunal for the purpose of producing a  persuasion  positive      or negative on the part of  the  tribunal  as  to  the  truth  of  a      proposition not of law or of logic on which  the  determination  of      the tribunal is to be asked    the  provision  and  the  abovementioned  definitions  clearly      suggest that it is an  exhaustive  definition    wherever  the  words      means and include are used it is an indication of the fact that the      definition is a hard and fast definition and no other  meaning  can      be assigned to the expression that is put down in the  definition  it      indicates an exhaustive explanation of  the  meaning  which  for  the      purposes of the act must invariably be attached  to  these  words  or      expression vide ms mahalakshmi

this  court  in  raj  kishore      prasad  wherein it was held that in order to apply section       crpc it is essential that the need to proceed against  the  person      other than the accused appearing to be guilty of offence  arises  only      on evidence recorded in the course of an inquiry or trial   in lal suraj  suraj singh  anr v state of jharkhand         scc  a twojudge bench of this court held that a court  framing      a charge would have before it all the materials on record  which  were      required to be proved by the prosecution in a  case  where  however      the court exercises its jurisdiction under section    crpc  the      power has to be exercised on the basis of the fresh  evidence  brought      before the court there lies a fine but clear distinction   a similar view has been reiterated by  this  court  in  rajendra      singh v state of up  anr air  sc  observing that  court      should not exercise the power under section  crpc on  the  basis      of materials available in the chargesheet or the case diary  because      such materials contained in the chargesheet or the case diary do  not      constitute evidence  the  word  evidence  in  section    crpc      contemplates the evidence of witnesses given in the court   ordinarily it is only after the charges  are  framed  that  the      stage of recording of evidence is reached a bare perusal  of  section       crpc would show that the legislature has used the terms record      of the case and the documents submitted therewith it  is  in  this      context that the word evidence as appearing in section    crpc      has to be read and understood the material collected at the stage  of      investigation can at best be used for a limited  purpose  as  provided      under  section    of  the  evidence  act  ie  to  corroborate  or      contradict the statements of the witnesses recorded before the  court      therefore for the exercise of power under section    crpc  the      use of word evidence means material that has come before  the  court      during an inquiry or trial by  it  and  not  otherwise  if  from  the      evidence led in the trial the court is of the opinion  that  a  person      not accused before it has also committed the offence  it  may  summon      such person under section  crpc   with respect to documentary evidence it is sufficient  as  can      be seen from a bare perusal of section  of the evidence act  as  well      as the decision of the constitution bench that a document is required      to be produced and proved according to  law  to  be  called  evidence      whether  such  evidence  is  relevant   irrelevant   admissible   or      inadmissible is a matter of trial   it is therefore clear that the word evidence in section        crpc means only such evidence as  is  made  before  the  court  in      relation to statements and as produced before the court in  relation      to documents it is only such evidence that can be taken into  account      by the magistrate or the court to decide whether power  under  section       crpc is to be exercised  and  not  on  the  basis  of  material      collected during investigation   the  inquiry  by  the  court  is  neither  attributable  to  the      investigation nor  the  prosecution  but  by  the  court  itself  for      collecting information to draw back a  curtain  that  hides  something      material it is the duty of the court to do so and therefore the power      to perform this duty is provided under the crpc   the unveiling of facts other than the material collected  during      investigation before the magistrate or  court  before  trial  actually      commences is part of the process of inquiry such facts when  recorded      during trial are evidence it is evidence only on  the  basis  whereof      trial can be held but can the same definition  be  extended  for  any      other material collected during inquiry by the magistrate or court for      the purpose of section  crpc   an inquiry can be conducted by the magistrate or  court  at  any      stage during the proceedings before the court this power is preserved      with the court and has to be  read  and  understood  accordingly  the      outcome of any such exercise should not be an impediment in the speedy      trial of the case   though the facts so received by the magistrate or the court  may      not be evidence yet it is some material that makes things  clear  and      unfolds  concealed  or  deliberately  suppressed  material  that   may      facilitate the trial in the context of section  crpc it  is  an      information of complicity such material therefore can be  used  even      though not an evidence in stricto sensuo but an information on record      collected by the  court  during  inquiry  itself  as  a  prima  facie      satisfaction for exercising the powers as presently involved   this pretrial stage is a stage where  no  adjudication  on  the      evidence of the offences involved takes place and therefore after the      material alongwith the chargesheet has been brought before the court      the same can be inquired into in order  to  effectively  proceed  with      framing of charges after the charges are framed the  prosecution  is      asked to lead evidence and till that is done  there  is  no  evidence      available in the strict legal sense of section  of the evidence  act      the actual trial of the offence by bringing  the  accused  before  the      court has still not begun what is available is the material that  has      been submitted before the court along with the chargesheet  in  such      situation the court only has the preparatory material that  has  been      placed before the court for its consideration in order to proceed with      the trial by framing of charges   it is therefore not any material that can be utilised  rather      it is that material after cognizance is taken  by  a  court  that  is      available to it while making an inquiry into  or  trying  an  offence      that the court can utilize or take into consideration  for  supporting      reasons to summon any person on the basis of evidence  adduced  before      the court who may be on the basis of such material treated to be  an      accomplice in the commission of the offence  the inference  that  can      be drawn is that material  which  is  not  exactly  evidence  recorded      before the court but is a material collected by  the  court  can  be      utilised to corroborate evidence already recorded for the  purpose  of      summoning any other person other than the accused   this would harmonise such material with the word  evidence  as      material  that  would  be  supportive  in  nature  to  facilitate  the      exposition of any other accomplice whose complicity in the offence may      have either been suppressed or escaped the notice of the court   the word evidence therefore has to be understood in its  wider      sense both at the stage of trial and as discussed  earlier  even  at      the stage of inquiry as used under section    crpc  the  court      therefore should be understood to have the power to  proceed  against      any person after summoning him on the basis of any  such  material  as      brought forth before it  the duty and obligation of the court becomes      more onerous to invoke such powers cautiously on such  material  after      evidence has been led during trial   in  view  of  the  discussion  made  and  the  conclusion  drawn      hereinabove the answer to the aforesaid question posed is that  apart      from evidence recorded  during  trial  any  material  that  has  been      received by the court after cognizance is taken and before  the  trial      commences can be utilised only for corroboration and to  support  the      evidence recorded by the court to invoke the power under  section        crpc  the evidence is thus  limited  to  the  evidence  recorded      during trialq       does the word evidence in section  crpc means  as      arising  in  examinationinchief  or  also   together   with   cross      examination   the second question referred to herein is  in  relation  to  the      word evidence as used under section   crpc  which  leaves  no      room for doubt that the evidence as understood under section  of  the      evidence act is the statement  of  the  witnesses  that  are  recorded      during trial and the  documentary  evidence  in  accordance  with  the      evidence act which also includes the document and  material  evidence      in the evidence act  such evidence begins with the statement  of  the      prosecution witnesses  therefore  is  evidence  which  includes  the      statement during examinationinchief  in rakesh  it was held      that it is true that finally at the time of trial the accused  is  to      be given an opportunity to  crossexamine  the  witness  to  test  its      truthfulness but that stage would  not  arise  while  exercising  the      courts power under section  crpc once the deposition is recorded      no doubt there being no crossexamination it would be a  prima  facie      material which would enable  the  sessions  court  to  decide  whether      powers under section  should be exercised or not in ranjit  singh       this court held that it is not necessary for  the  court  to      wait until the entire evidence is collected for exercising the  said      power in mohd shafi  it was held that the prerequisite  for      exercise of power under section  crpc was  the  satisfaction  of      the court to proceed against a  person  who  is  not  an  accused  but      against whom evidence occurs for which the court can even  wait  till      the cross examination is over and that there would be no illegality in      doing so a similar view has been taken by a twojudge  bench  in  the      case of harbhajan singh  anr v state of punjab  anr   scc this court in hardeep singh  seems  to  have  misread  the      judgment in mohd  shafi    as  it  construed  that  the  said      judgment laid down that for the exercise of power  under  section        crpc the court has to necessarily wait till the witness  is  cross      examined and  on  complete  appreciation  of  evidence  come  to  the      conclusion whether there is  a  need  to  proceed  under  section        crpc   we have given our thoughtful consideration to the diverse  views      expressed in the aforementioned cases  once  examinationinchief  is      conducted the statement becomes part of the record it is evidence as      per law and in the true sense for at best it may be  rebuttable  an      evidence  being  rebutted  or  controverted  becomes   a   matter   of      consideration relevance and belief which is the stage of judgment by      the court yet it is evidence and it is material on the basis  whereof      the court can come to a prima facie opinion as to complicity  of  some      other person who may be connected with the offence   as held in mohd shafi  and harbhajan singh   all      that is required for the exercise  of  the  power  under  section        crpc is that it must appear to the court that  some  other  person      also who is not facing the trial may also have been involved  in  the      offence the prerequisite for the exercise of this power  is  similar      to the prima facie view which the magistrate must come to in order  to      take cognizance of the offence therefore no straightjacket  formula      can and should be  laid  with  respect  to  conditions  precedent  for      arriving at such an opinion and if the magistratecourt is  convinced      even on the basis of evidence appearing  in  examinationinchief  it      can exercise the power under  section    crpc  and  can  proceed      against such other person it is essential to note that the section      also uses the words such person could be tried instead of should  be      tried hence what is required is not to have  a  minitrial  at  this      stage by  having  examination  and  crossexamination  and  thereafter      rendering a decision on the overt act of  such  person  sought  to  be      added in fact it is this minitrial that would affect the  right  of      the person sought to be arraigned as an accused rather than not having      any crossexamination at all for in light of subsection  of section       crpc the person would be entitled to a fresh  trial  where  he      would have all  the  rights  including  the  right  to  cross  examine      prosecution witnesses and examine defence witnesses  and  advance  his      arguments upon the same therefore even on the basis of  examination      inchief the court or the magistrate can proceed against a person  as      long as the court is satisfied that  the  evidence  appearing  against      such person is such that it prima  facie  necessitates  bringing  such      person to face trial in fact examinationinchief untested by  cross      examination undoubtedly in itself is an evidence   further in our opinion there does not seem  to  be  any  logic      behind waiting till the crossexamination of the witness is  over  it      is to be kept in mind that at the time  of  exercise  of  power  under      section  crpc the person sought to be arraigned as an  accused      is in no way participating in the trial even if the crossexamination      is to be taken into consideration the person sought to  be  arraigned      as an accused cannot cross examine the witness prior to passing  of      an order under section    crpc  as  such  a  procedure  is  not      contemplated by the crpc secondly invariably the state  would  not      oppose or object to naming of more persons as an accused as  it  would      only help the prosecution in completing the chain of evidence  unless      the witness is obliterating the  role  of  persons  already  facing      trial  more so section   crpc  enables  the  court  to  record      evidence in absence of the  accused  in  the  circumstances  mentioned      therein   thus in view of the above we hold that power under section       crpc can be exercised at the stage of completion of examination  in      chief and court does not need to wait till the said evidence is tested      on crossexamination for it is the satisfaction of the court which can      be gathered from the reasons recorded by  the  court  in  respect  of      complicity of some other  person  not  facing  the  trial  in  the      offenceq  what is the degree of satisfaction required for  invoking  the      power under section  crpc   section  crpc empowers the  court  to  proceed  against      other persons who appear to  be  guilty  of  offence  though  not  an      accused before the courtthe word appear means  clear  to  the  comprehension  or  a      phrase near to if not synonymous with

 of the word appear the court held that the appropriate  meaning  of      the  word  appears  is  seems  it  imports  a  lesser  degree  of      probability than proofin ram singh  ors   v  ram  niwas    anr        scc  a twojudge bench of this court was  again  required      to examine the importance of the word appear  as  appearing  in  the      section the court held that for the fulfillment of the condition that      it appears to the court that a person had committed  an  offence  the      court must satisfy  itself  about  the  existence  of  an  exceptional      circumstance enabling it to exercise  an  extraordinary  jurisdiction      what is therefore  necessary  for  the  court  is  to  arrive  at  a      satisfaction that the evidence adduced on behalf of  the  prosecution      if unrebutted may lead to conviction of  the  persons  sought  to  be      added as an accused in the case   at the time of taking cognizance the court has to see whether a      prima facie case is made out to proceed against  the  accused   under      section  crpc though the test of prima facie case is the  same      the degree of satisfaction that is required is much stricter  a  two      judge bench of this court in vikas v state of  rajasthan          scale  held that on the  objective  satisfaction  of  the  court  a      person may be arrested or summoned as the  circumstances  of  the      case may require if it appears from the evidence that any such person      not being the accused has committed an offence for which  such  person      could be tried together with the already arraigned accused persons   in rajendra singh  the court observed   in mohd shafi  this court held that it is evident  that      before a court exercises its discretionary jurisdiction  in  terms  of      section  crpc it must  arrive  at  a  satisfaction  that  there      exists a possibility that the accused so summoned  in  all  likelihood      would be convicted   in sarabjit singh  anr v state of punjab  anr air   sc       while explaining the scope of section  crpc  a  twojudge      bench of this court observed   in brindaban das   ors v state of west bengal  air    sc       a twojudge bench of this court took a  similar  view  observing      that the court is required to consider whether such evidence would  be      sufficient to convict the person being  summoned  since  issuance  of      summons under section  crpc entails a de novo trial and a  large      number of witnesses may have been examined  and  their  reexamination      could prejudice the prosecution and delay the trial the  trial  court      has to exercise such discretion with great care and perspicacitya similar view has been reiterated by  this  court  in  michael      machado  anr v central bureau of investigation  ors air   sc         however there is a series of cases  wherein  this  court  while      dealing with the provisions of sections              and  crpc has consistently held that  the court at the stage of      framing of the charge has to apply its mind to the question whether or      not there is any ground for presuming the commission of an offence  by      the accused  the court has to see as to whether the material  brought      on record reasonably connect the accused  with  the  offence  nothing      more is required to be enquired into while dealing with the aforesaid      provisions the test of prima facie case is to be applied  the  court      has to find out whether the materials offered by the prosecution to be      adduced as evidence are sufficient for the court  to  proceed  against      the accused further vide state of  karnataka  v  l  munishwamy        ors air  sc  all india bank officers confederation etc v      union of india  ors  air    sc    stree  atyachar  virodhi      parishad v dilip nathumal chordia   scc  state of mp v      dr krishna chandra saksena   scc  and state of  mp  v      mohan lal soni air  sc    in dilawar babu kurane v state of maharashtra air  sc       this court while dealing with the provisions of sections   and        crpc placed a very heavy reliance on the earlier judgment of  this      court in union of india v prafulla kumar samal  anr  air    sc       and held that while  considering  the  question  of   framing  the      charges the court may weigh the evidence for the limited  purpose  of      finding out whether or not a prima facie case against the accused  has      been made out and whether  the  materials  placed  before  this  court      disclose grave suspicion  against  the  accused  which  has  not  been      properly explained  in such an eventuality the court is justified in      framing the charges and proceeding with the trial  the court  has  to      consider the broad probabilities of the case the total effect of  the      evidence and the documents produced before the court but court  should      not make a roving enquiry into the pros and cons  of  the  matter  and      weigh evidence as if it is conducting a trial   in suresh v state of maharashtra air  sc  this  court      after taking note of the earlier judgments  in  niranjan  singh  karam      singh punjabi v jitendra bhimraj bijjaya air  sc  and  state      of maharashtra v priya sharan maharaj  air   sc    held  as      under   similarly in state of bihar v ramesh singh air   sc        while dealing with the issue this court held   in palanisamy gounder  anr v state represented by  inspector      of police   scc  this court deprecated  the  practice  of      invoking the power under section  crpc just to conduct a fishing      inquiry as in that case the trial court exercised that power just to      find out the real truth though there was no valid ground  to  proceed      against the person summoned by the court   power under section  crpc is a discretionary and an extra      ordinary power it is to be exercised  sparingly  and  only  in  those      cases where the circumstances of the case so warrant it is not to  be      exercised because the magistrate or  the  sessions  judge  is  of  the      opinion that some other person may also be guilty of  committing  that      offence only where strong and cogent evidence occurs against a person      from the evidence led before the  court  that  such  power  should  be      exercised and not in a casual and cavalier manner   thus we hold that though only a  prima  facie  case  is  to  be      established from the evidence led before  the  court  not  necessarily      tested on the anvil of crossexamination it  requires  much  stronger      evidence than mere probability of his complicity the test that has to      be applied is one which is more than prima facie case as exercised  at      the time of framing of charge but short of satisfaction to an  extent      that the evidence if goes unrebutted would lead  to  conviction  in      the absence of  such  satisfaction  the  court  should  refrain  from      exercising power under section  crpc  in section  crpc the      purpose of providing if it appears from the evidence that any  person      not being the accused has committed any offence  is  clear  from  the      words for  which  such  person  could  be  tried  together  with  the      accused  the words used are not for  which  such  person  could  be      convicted  there is therefore no scope for the court acting  under      section  crpc to form  any  opinion  as  to  the  guilt  of  the      accusedq  in  what  situations  can  the  power  under  this  section  be      exercised not named in fir named in the fir but  not  chargesheeted      or has been discharged  in joginder singh  anr v state of punjab  anr air   sc       a threejudge bench of  this  court  held  that  as  regards  the      contention  that  the  phrase  any  person  not  being  the  accused      occurring in section    crpc  excludes  from  its  operation  an      accused who has been released by the police under section   crpc      and has been shown in column  of the chargesheet the contention has      merely to be rejected the said expression clearly covers  any  person      who is not being tried already by the court and the  very  purpose  of      enacting such a provision like section   crpc  clearly  shows      that  even  persons  who  have  been  dropped  by  the  police  during      investigation but against whom evidence showing their  involvement  in      the offence comes before the criminal court are included in the  said      expression  in anju chaudhary v state of up  anr   scc    a      twojudge bench of this court held that even in the cases where report      under section  crpc is filed in the court  and  investigation      records the name of a person in column or even does  not  name  the      person as an accused at all the  court  in  exercise  of  its  powers      vested under section  crpc can summon the person as  an  accused      and even at that stage of summoning no hearing is contemplated  under      the law  in suman v state of rajasthan  anr air  sc   a  two      judge bench of this court  observed  that  there  is  nothing  in  the      language of this subsection from which it  can  be  inferred  that  a      person who is named in the fir or complaint but against whom  charge      sheet is not filed by the police cannot  be  proceeded  against  even      though in the course of any inquiry into or trial of any offence  the      court finds that such person has committed an  offence  for  which  he      could be tried together with the other accused in lal suraj        a twojudge bench held  that  there  is  no  dispute  with  the  legal      proposition that even if a person had not been chargesheeted he  may      come within the purview  of  the  description  of  such  a  person  as      contained in section  crpc a similar view had been taken in  lok      ram   wherein it was held that a person though had  initially      been named in the fir as an accused but not chargesheeted can  also      be added to face the trial  even the constitution bench in dharam pal  has held that the      sessions court can also exercise its original jurisdiction and  summon      a person as an accused in case his name appears in  column    of  the      chargesheet once the case had been committed to it  it means that  a      person whose  name  does  not  appear  even  in  the  fir  or  in  the      chargesheet or whose name appears in the fir and not in the main  part      of the chargesheet but in column  and has not  been  summoned  as  an      accused in exercise of the powers under section  crpc can  still      be summoned by the court provided the court  is  satisfied  that  the      conditions provided in the said statutory provisions stand  fulfilled  however there is a great difference with regard to a person who      has been discharged a person who has  been  discharged  stands  on  a      different  footing  than  a  person  who  was   never   subjected   to      investigation or if subjected  to  but  not  chargesheeted  such  a      person has stood the stage  of  inquiry  before  the  court  and  upon      judicial examination of the material collected  during  investigation      the court had come to the conclusion that there is not  even  a  prima      facie case to proceed against such person  generally  the  stage  of      evidence in trial is merely  proving  the  material  collected  during      investigation and therefore there is not much change as  regards  the      material existing against the person so discharged  therefore  there      must exist compelling circumstances to exercise such power the  court      should keep in mind that the witness when giving evidence against  the      person so discharged is not doing so merely to  seek  revenge  or  is      naming him at the behest of  someone  or  for  such  other  extraneous      considerations the court has  to  be  circumspect  in  treating  such      evidence and try to separate the chaff from the grain if  after  such      careful examination of the evidence the court is of the opinion  that      there does exist evidence to proceed against the person so discharged      it may take steps but only in  accordance  with  section    crpc      without resorting to the provision of section  crpc directly  in sohan lal  ors v state of rajasthan   scc    a      twojudge bench of this court held  that  once  an  accused  has  been      discharged the procedure for  enquiry  envisaged  under  section        crpc cannot be  circumvented  by  prescribing  to  procedure  under      section  crpc  in municipal corporation of delhi v ram kishan rohtagi   ors      air  sc  this court held that if the  prosecution  can  at  any      stage produce evidence which satisfies the court that those  who  have      not been arraigned as accused or against whom  proceedings  have  been      quashed  have  also  committed  the  offence  the  court  can   take      cognizance against them under section  crpc and try  them  along      with the other accused  power under section  crpc is in the nature  of  revisional      power which can be exercised only by the high court  or  the  sessions      judge as the case may be according to section      crpc  a      person discharged under section  crpc shall not be  tried  again      for the same offence except with the consent of the court by which  he      was discharged or of any other  court  to  which  the  firstmentioned      court is subordinate further section  crpc provides  that  the      high court or  the  sessions  judge  may  direct  the  chief  judicial      magistrate by himself or by any of the magistrate subordinate  to  him      to make an inquiry into the case against any person  who  has  already      been discharged  both these provisions contemplate an  inquiry  to  be  conducted      before any person who has already been discharged is asked to  again      face trial if some evidence appears  against  him  as  held  earlier      section  crpc can also be invoked at the stage of inquiry we do      not see any reason why  inquiry  as  contemplated  by  section        crpc and section  crpc cannot be an inquiry under section       crpc accordingly a person discharged can also be  arraigned  again      as an accused but only after an inquiry as  contemplated  by  sections       and  crpc if during or after such inquiry there  appears      to be an evidence against such person power under section  crpc      can be exercised we may clarify that the word trial  under  section       crpc would be eclipsed by virtue of above  provisions  and  the      same cannot be invoked so far as a person discharged is concerned but      no more  thus it is evident that power under section  crpc can  be      exercised against a person not subjected to investigation or a person      placed in the column  of the chargesheet and against whom cognizance      had not been taken or a person  who  has  been  discharged  however      concerning a person who has been discharged  no  proceedings  can  be      commenced against him  directly  under  section    crpc  without      taking recourse to provisions of section  read with section        crpc we accordingly sum up our conclusions as followsquestion nos  iii      q what is the stage at which power under section   crpc can be      exercisedand      qiii whether the word evidence used in section   crpc  has      been used in a comprehensive sense and includes the evidence collected      during investigation or the word evidence is limited to the evidence      recorded during triala in dharam pals case the constitution bench has already held  that      after committal cognizance of an  offence  can  be  taken  against  a      person not  named  as  an  accused  but  against  whom  materials  are      available from the papers filed by  the  police  after  completion  of      investigation such cognizance can be taken under section   crpc      and the sessions judge need not wait till evidence under section       crpc becomes available for summoning an additional accused      section  crpc significantly uses  two  expressions  that      have to be taken note of ie    inquiry    trial  as  a  trial      commences after framing of charge an inquiry can only  be  understood      to be a pretrial inquiry inquiries  under  sections            crpc and under section  crpc  are  species  of  the  inquiry      contemplated by section  crpc materials coming before the  court      in course of such enquiries can  be  used  for  corroboration  of  the      evidence recorded in the court after  the  trial  commences  for  the      exercise of power under section    crpc  and  also  to  add  an      accused whose name has been shown in column  of the chargesheetin view of the above position the word evidence in section       crpc has to  be  broadly  understood  and  not  literally  ie  as      evidence brought during a trialquestion no ii      qii whether the word evidence used in section  crpc  could      only mean evidence  tested  by  crossexamination  or  the  court  can      exercise the power under the said provision even on the basis  of  the      statement made in the examinationinchief of the witness concerneda considering the fact  that  under  section    crpc  a  person      against whom material is disclosed is only summoned to face the  trial      and in such an event  under  section    crpc  the  proceeding      against such person is  to  commence  from  the  stage  of  taking  of      cognizance the court need not  wait  for  the  evidence  against  the      accused proposed to be summoned to be tested by crossexaminationquestion no iv      qiv what is the nature of the satisfaction  required  to  invoke  the      power under section  crpc to arraign  an  accused  whether  the      power under section   crpc can be exercised only if the court      is satisfied that the accused  summoned  will  in  all  likelihood  be      convicteda though under section   crpc  the  accused  subsequently      impleaded is to be treated as if he had been an accused when the court      initially took cognizance of the offence the degree  of  satisfaction      that will be required for summoning a person under section  crpc      would be the same as for framing  a  charge  the  difference  in  the      degree of satisfaction  for  summoning  the  original  accused  and  a      subsequent accused is on account of the fact that the trial  may  have      already commenced against the original accused and it is in the course      of such trial that materials are disclosed against the newly  summoned      accused fresh summoning of an accused will result  in  delay  of  the      trial  therefore the degree of satisfaction for summoning the accused      original and subsequent has to be differentquestion nov      qv does the power under section  crpc  extend  to  persons  not      named in the fir or named in the fir but not chargesheeted or who have      been dischargeda    a person not named in the fir or a person though  named  in  the      fir but has not been chargesheeted or a person who has been discharged      can be summoned under section  crpc provided from  the  evidence      it appears that such person  can  be  tried  along  with  the  accused      already facing trial however in so far as an accused  who  has  been      discharged is concerned the  requirement  of  sections    and         crpc has to be complied with before he can be summoned afreshthe matters be placed before the  appropriate  bench  for  final      disposal in accordance with law explained hereinabovecjip sathasivam                                   jdr bs chauhan      jranjana prakash desai
